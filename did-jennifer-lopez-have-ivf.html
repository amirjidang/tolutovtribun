Over the years, <a href=#>JLo has denied having any procedures done</a> to preserve her youthful glow, often crediting special beauty products (her own line, of course) over botox. Lopez has shared details of her workout routine and is often photographed hitting the gym, but some fans are just not buying it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their suspicion about Jennifer Lopez's youthfulness grew when the star denied using in vitro fertilization to conceive her twins. Max and Emme arrived when their mom was already at "advanced maternal age," and many fans simply don't believe that Jennifer conceived naturally. Here's why fans think JLo is lying about not just plastic surgery, but about how her children were conceived.</p><h2 id=did-jennifer-lopez-have-ivf>Did Jennifer Lopez Have IVF?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/marc-anthony-had-a-star-studded-wedding-with-nadia-ferreira-but-were-his-kids-with-j-lo-snubbed-of-an-invite_.jpg><p>Ever since news broke that she and her ex-husband Marc Anthony were expecting twins, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lopez has maintained that the babies were conceived naturally</a>, without the aid of in vitro fertilization.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She explicitly stated in an interview that "<strong>It was natural. We didn't do in vitro. Everyone assumed that, because we had twins.</strong>"</p><p>Lopez has also been criticized for her reported stance on in vitro fertilization and similar procedures. Asked about whether she underwent IVF to conceive her twins, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer was adamant that she did not</a>, due to her personal beliefs.</p><p>I just felt like you don’t mess with things like that. And I guess deep down I really felt like either this is not going to happen for me or it is. You know what I mean? And if it is, it will. And if it’s not, it’s not going to.</p><p>Jennifer Lopez gave birth to her twins when she was 38 years old, something that may have given fans renewed hope that conception could happen for them even beyond "advanced" maternal age.</p><p>But critics think Jennifer went about the pregnancy conversation the wrong way, and that she might even be lying about how her babies were conceived.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-think-jennifer-lopez-might-have-had-her-twins-via-ivf>Fans Think Jennifer Lopez Might Have Had Her Twins Via IVF</h2><p>Despite JLo's statements both against IVF and about the apparently natural conception of her and Marc Anthony's twins, many people aren't buying it.</p><p>In a conversation spurred by the news of then-54-year-old Brigitte Nielsen's pregnancy news (it was her fifth child), <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditors were disappointed about celebrities' apparent lack of transparency</a> surrounding IVF and other fertility procedures.</p><p>Many speculated that Brigitte and other celebrity moms had frozen their eggs long before they fell pregnant with the help of IVF.
