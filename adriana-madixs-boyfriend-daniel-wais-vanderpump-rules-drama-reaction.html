Like anyone who has been through something as terrible as infidelity, Ariana definitely seems to be ready for a healthier love story that doesn't have all the drama of her past relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Customers Like Schwartz And Sandy’s Before The Explosive Tom Sandoval Scandal On Vanderpump Rules?</a></span></p><p>Ariana Madix told Today.com in May 2023 that when she and Daniel Wai were both at a wedding that spring, they began chatting, and they began dating.

She said, "I met him at this wedding and all we did was talk. Like we stayed up all night just talking. . . . It's literally all I wanted."</p><p>Ariana also said of the romance, “I would say it’s really, really great.

Since he seems to really care about Ariana, he must feel terrible about what she went through.</p><p>Daniel has become a big part of Ariana's life. In September 2023, Page Six reported that the Vanderpump Rules stars traveled to San Francisco together, and he was there, too.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Tom Sandoval Have A Higher Net Worth Than Vanderpump Rules Co-Star Raquel Leviss?</a></span></p><p>In general, Daniel seems to be comfortable with the world of reality TV. According to Page Six, in August 2023, the couple went out in New York City when Summer House cast member Lindsay Hubbard turned 37.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/daniel-wai.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In August 2023, Us Weekly reported that Daniel was on a plane and Vanderpump Rules was one of the TV options. He joked about whether he should tune in and posted on social media, “Seriously @united. Wait should I watch?”</p><p>Since Ariana Madix and Tom Sandoval are still living together as of early September 2023, it's possible to assume that anyone who begins dating Ariana will have to feel okay and comfortable with that.</p><p>Ariana talked about living in the house that she bought with Tom on former Scheananigans, the podcast that Scheana Shay hosts. Ariana said, "I have a pretty decent little setup. I stay in my room or I go in the kitchen if I have to. My room is kind of like a little apartment. I don't see him, I don't interact with him, and I stay in my own little zone. I'm busy, I've got a lot going on. I am not f---ing around with my life, and I am not letting somebody else's horrible decisions ruin my future. I'm taking care of myself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Was The Whole 'Scandoval' Drama Faked For Vanderpump Rules Ratings?</a></span></p><p>In the same podcast interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Madix talked about Daniel Wai</a> as well. She explained that when she had to make a phone call related to her credit card, he said that he would take care of that errand for her.</p><p>Ariana said, “He’s like, ‘I’m gonna call them. I know you wanna do everything yourself, but I’m gonna just go ahead and do it." She also said, “He’s a very grounding, calming, positive energy.

While Ariana hasn't shared any details about what kinds of conversations she and Daniel had about Tom, it's likely that Daniel supports her 100 percent.</p><p>Since Ariana Madix and Daniel Wai's relationship seems blissful, fans would love for their romance to last.</p><p>These days, several months after the Vanderpump Rules scandal, the reality star definitely sounds confident. In May 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Madix talked about Tom Sandoval</a> in an interview with The New York Times. She also mentioned the various things that she has shared on the reality show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ariana-madix-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ariana said, “I’ve always had a little bit of that anxiousness about saying something that would upset someone or whatever, and I still have that to some degree. But I also feel as though the worst possible things that could happen to somebody happened to me on this show: the loss of Charlotte, my dog of 18 years, the loss of my grandma, this whole thing happening very publicly. Part of me feels like, What’s the worst that can happen? The worst already did. So going forward, it feels a little bit like, What can I not handle at this point?”</p><p>When Vanderpump Rules comes back for season 11, it's possible that Daniel Wai will be in a few episodes or even just a few scenes since he and Ariana Madix have gotten so close. It will be fun to see more of this relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnaqZlruiecyam6Kwo2KvsMXFq6CeppRisaK6yJ6jZq%2BRnsBuwsCnm56qoKq6sXnRrqOeq12Zv6K5wGapnpmTqbawuo4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fadriana-madixs-boyfriend-daniel-wais-vanderpump-rules-drama-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fadriana-madixs-boyfriend-daniel-wais-vanderpump-rules-drama-reaction.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fadriana-madixs-boyfriend-daniel-wais-vanderpump-rules-drama-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fadriana-madixs-boyfriend-daniel-wais-vanderpump-rules-drama-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fadriana-madixs-boyfriend-daniel-wais-vanderpump-rules-drama-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fadriana-madixs-boyfriend-daniel-wais-vanderpump-rules-drama-reaction.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-pronounce-sanofi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-pronounce-sanofi.html>How to pronounce sanofi</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./fans-reacts-to-v1nce-cuh-face-reveal-on-social-media-platforms-505781-html.html>Fans Reacts To V1nce Cuh Face Reveal On Social Media Platforms</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./fans-reacts-to-v1nce-cuh-face-reveal-on-social-media-platforms-505781-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
