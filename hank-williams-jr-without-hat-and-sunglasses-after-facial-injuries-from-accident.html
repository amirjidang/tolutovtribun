He is never seen without shades or sunglasses.</p><p>But lately, he was encountered in public without his usual hat and glasses and his eyes were visible for the first time.</p><p>People thought something might have happened to him but the singer didn’t speak about anything regarding his change of style for that day. He has always kept his glass and hat both indoors and outdoors, or while performing songs.</p><p>Hank’s music career was starting off but he was tired of being the impersonator of his dad. In an extreme scenario, it also led him to think of suicide but later through the advice of his doctor, he moved to Alabama to focus on music.</p><p>In Alabama, he worked with Charlie Daniels, Waylon Jennings, and the Marshall Tucker Band and then released his breakout album,&nbsp;Hank Williams Jr. & Friends,&nbsp;in 1975.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-williams-jr-facial-injuries-from-accident></span>Hank Williams Jr Facial Injuries From Accident<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hank Williams Jr suffered from a fatal&nbsp;fall&nbsp;when he went hiking in Montana with Williams and a buddy, Dick Willey on August 8, 1975. He was treading near the Idaho border around Ajax Lake.</p><p>He had seen a snowfield about a thousand feet below it and tried to cross it but the snow underneath him gave way, which made him fall down the mountain about 500 feet.</p><p>While falling his face struck a boulder causing fractures in his skull in various places. The impact of the fall was so great that his nose, teeth, and jaw were broken to pieces and his eye was hanging out of the socket.</p><p>It was due to this incident and injuries that Hank has always kept his appearance with Hat and Sunglasses.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hank-williams-jr-wife-death-what-happened-to-her></span>Hank Williams Jr Wife death- What Happened To Her?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hank Williams Jr’s wife Mary Jane Thomas died on March 22, 2022, in Jupiter, Florida.</p><p>When she passed out unexpectedly, she was taken to the hospital immediately, but the doctors pronounced her dead upon her arrival.
