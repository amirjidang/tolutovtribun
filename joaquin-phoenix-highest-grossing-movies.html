made <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$28,563,179 </a>at the box office, with the crime drama starring Joaquin Phoenix alongside Mark Whalberg in what was a star-studded cast.</p><p>Phoenix plays the manager of a nightclub in this movie named, Bobby Green, which happens to be frequented by a Russian mobster, however, Phoenix's character just so happens to be related to many members of the NYPD.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The movie has plenty of heart within, as the story

remains one of Joaquin Phoenix's top 10 highest-grossing movies of all time so far in his career.</p><p>The film has a very negative review on Rotten Tomatoes, with a 22% rating, which is likely why it isn't discussed as one of his greatest roles, yet it still managed to do a respectable number at the box office.</p><p>However, the fact that the film almost doubled its initial $40 million budget means that it was considered to be a huge success as far as producers were concerned.</p><h2 id=ladder-49-box-office-74-541-707>Ladder 49 (Box Office: $74,541,707)</h2><p>Ladder 49 is a classic

earned an impressive $85,336,277 at the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> box office</a> and was a very fun film, backed by an incredible soundtrack provided by the legendary Phil
