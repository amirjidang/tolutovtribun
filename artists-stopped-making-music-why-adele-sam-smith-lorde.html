Sometimes fans are lucky though, and what seemed to be a retirement was just a long hiatus. Either way, there are different reasons why artists decide to call it quits. Here are ten artists who stopped making and why.</p><h2 id=adele><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Adele</span></h2><p>The <a href=#>amazing singer</a> behind countless hits has a history of making her fans wait. But when she finally releases her music, it's always incredible. However, in 2012, a year after a triumphant tour of Europe and North America for her record 21, Adele announced she was taking a break and not to expect new music soon.</p><p>"I have to take time and live a little bit. There were a good two years between my first and second albums, so it'll be the same this time," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>. The album, 25, ended up being released in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shania-twain><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Shania Twain</span></h2><p>Shania conquered the world with her hit Man! I Feel Like A Woman in the early 2000s, but in 2004 she entered a hiatus that ended up lasting over six years. The reasons behind this? She was diagnosed with Lyme disease and developed dysphonia, which directly affected her ability to sing.</p><p>Shania was forced to stop making music, but with patience and years of rehabilitation, she finally got her voice back. "Getting through all of that, I'm encouraged now and I feel like I can tour again and I'll make more records. So I'm feeling really successful with that challenge," <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>.</p><h2 id=soundgarden><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Soundgarden</span></h2><p>Soundgarden was one of the greatest bands from the Grunge music scene, and they inspired countless other artists around the world. Which is why it was such a shock for fans when they broke up in 1998, after two incredibly successful albums.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The truth is that there was tension between the musicians because of the band's overwhelming success. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drummer Matt Cameron said</a> that the band had been "eaten up by the business." In 2012, over a decade after the official breakup, the band got back together and released a record. They stayed together until Chris Cornell's death in 2017.</p><h2 id=one-direction><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>One Direction</span></h2><p>Everybody knows <a href=#>the band</a> broke up, leaving a trail of broken hearts behind them. They were at the peak of their career, with a long list of <a href=#>amazing hits</a>. The members all have their solo projects now, but ten years after the formation of the band, let's review why they stopped making music together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Times Harry Styles Proved To Be A Great Role Model</a></span></p><p>"The <a href=#>1D</a> thing just ran its course. They’ll remain friends, but they are exhausted and want solo careers," a close source told <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Magazine</a>. There's still the possibility of a reunion, but in the meantime, fans can enjoy their solo work, which is amazing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sam-smith><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sam Smith</span></h2><p>Sam Smith has had a long list of popular hits, including number 1 single Too Good At Goodbyes. After working tirelessly for years, in 2015 Sam decided to take a break from music.</p><p>This decision was difficult but necessary, Sam said. "I am sad, but I'm also - it feels right," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the singer said.</a> "I've been playing now for three years nonstop, and it feels right for me to just go home and live my life - just be a 23-year-old." However, in 2017, Sam announced he was back to making music.</p><h2 id=rage-against-the-machine><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Rage Against The Machine</span></h2><p>This controversial band, which was incredibly successful in the 90s, first broke up in October 2000 with singer Zack De La Rocha's departure from the band. The differences, he said, were creative, and though there had been some conflict between the bandmates, they all got along.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I am extremely proud of our work, both as activists and musicians, as well as indebted and grateful to every person who has expressed solidarity and shared this incredible experience with us," <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the singer said</a>. The band has reunited a few times through the years, although they didn't make new music, and by the end of 2019, they announced they were getting back together, but they haven't made any new music yet.</p><h2 id=lorde><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lorde</span></h2><p>After the strenuous success of her debut album, Pure Heroine, Lorde took a long break from making music which made her fans impatient. Finally, four years after, she released her second album Melodrama. Lorde said a lot of things changed in her life after that record, and that she had to take some time to figure out who she was.</p><p>"For me, it was kind of about processing what I want to say next and I knew it just couldn’t be any old thing," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said about</a>Melodrama. "It had to be really special and really singular and it couldn’t sound the same as the old stuff and there was a lot of discovery that went on."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=foo-fighters><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Foo Fighters</span></h2><p>In 2014, the band released one of their most successful albums, Sonic Highways, and toured for a very long time. During one of the concerts, frontman Dave Grohl fell off the stage and broke his leg, but continued the show anyway, and then finished the tour playing from a costume made throne.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Dave Grohl's Net Worth Is More Than $300 Million: Here's How He Amassed His Fortune</a></span></p><p>But after the tour, the situation had been too stressful for the band and they decided to take a long break. Since they didn't give any explanations as to why they had stopped making music, breakup rumors started, but they cleared them up with a hilarious video. Finally, in 2017, they released the album Concrete and Gold.</p><h2 id=big-time-rush><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Big Time Rush</span></h2><p>This boy band became successful because they starred in the Nickelodeon series Big Time Rush and even though they never formally broke up, they've been on an indefinite hiatus ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>About their music, <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they said</a> "it’s not like it just disappears. But in terms of new content, it might be a while, but might not be ever. We don’t know at this point and we’ve all kind of been saying, 'we’re all really excited and really antsy to be our own individual artists outside the band — and support each other.'"</p><h2 id=pearl-jam><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Pearl Jam</span></h2><p>Pearl Jam is the only band from the Grunge era that has never broken up. They have a huge collection of hits, and they've released their new album, Gigaton, this year, which was very well-received. This album finally arrived after a seven-year-long hiatus. They would've liked to release it sooner, but certain events, including the death of their friend Chris Cornell (Soundgarden), got in the way and they had to stop making music for a while.</p><p>"It’d be fun to record or even just to write a song together," <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bassist Jeff Ament said</a>. "I think when Chris passed – that’s really been a tough one to wrap our heads around – and then there’s just life stuff."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Female Artists To Listen To If You Like Lana Del Rey</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq6yZqMG0edKtpqmolZl6rq3KoqWgZZ2qwKqvjLCfsmWRmbKtsYysmKZlo6K2tbSMpaarnJVk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fartists-stopped-making-music-why-adele-sam-smith-lorde.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fartists-stopped-making-music-why-adele-sam-smith-lorde.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fartists-stopped-making-music-why-adele-sam-smith-lorde.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fartists-stopped-making-music-why-adele-sam-smith-lorde.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fartists-stopped-making-music-why-adele-sam-smith-lorde.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fartists-stopped-making-music-why-adele-sam-smith-lorde.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./10-crazy-oreo-flavors-you-wont-believe-exist.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./10-crazy-oreo-flavors-you-wont-believe-exist.html>10 Crazy Oreo Flavors You Won't Believe Exist</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-last-dance-what-to-expect-from-week-3.html>'The Last Dance:' What To Expect From Week 3</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-last-dance-what-to-expect-from-week-3.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
