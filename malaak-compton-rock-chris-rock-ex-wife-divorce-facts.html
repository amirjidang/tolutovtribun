In fact, within the first few months of 2020, there already were a slew of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity relationships that ended</a>. Given the fact that most regular people tend to think of celebrities as being somehow different than the rest of us, it can be too easy to think of those breakups as juicy gossip.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In reality, when celebrity couples split, whether their partner is famous or not, it likely is a traumatic experience for everyone involved. On top of that, some of those celebrity relationships come to an end for really serious reasons. Of course, since most stars are very aware that their careers depend on their fans liking them, they tend to either keep the reasons for their breakups private or blame their former partner.</p><p>Remarkably enough, since Chris Rock and his wife of many years broke up in 2016, the comedian has been extremely open about why they split up. More importantly, during interviews, he has made it very clear that he deserves the blame for the way things played out. As for the exact things Rock has said about his divorce, you’ll need to read on to get a complete picture.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Rock And Howard Stern Got Revenge On Their High School Bullies</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=an-impressive-career>An Impressive Career</h2><p>In Hollywood, it can be extremely difficult for anyone to have a lasting career either as an actor or as a comedian. For that reason, there is no doubt that Chris Rock deserves a lot of credit since he has found long-lasting success in both arenas.</p><p>Introduced to the masses when he began starring in Saturday Night Live, Chris Rock managed to become a major movie star once he left that show behind. Most memorably, Rock starred in the Madagascar and Grown Ups franchises on top of stand-alone movies like Down to Earth and The Longest Yard. After years of stardom, Rock is in the midst of taking his acting career in a new direction at the time of this writing. Currently starring in the fourth season of TV’s Fargo, Rock has said that the show has given him the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best role of his career</a> and he is right.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Rock Reveals Why He's So Unapproachable</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=speaking-out>Speaking Out</h2><p>As a comedian, it is Chris Rock’s job to see the funny side of life and point it out for the people that show up to see him perform. For that reason, one year after Rock’s 2016 divorce was finalized, he started to address the situation in front of audiences and playing it up for laughs. For example, during one of Rock’s performances that was attended by an interviewer for Rolling Stone, Rock said he was “a piece of sh**” during his marriage.</p><p>Elaborating on what made him a bad husband during that same comedy show, Chris Rock spoke about the many times <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was unfaithful</a> to his wife. Talking about three women he slept with while married, according to that Rolling Stone interviewer, Rock said one was famous, another one was “semifamous, and the last one worked retail. Of course, Rock is far from the first <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity who has cheated</a> but, amazingly, he is willing to talk about his infidelity in great detail. Aware of how awful he’d been during his marriage, Rock then went on to urge the audience to hold on tightly to the people they love before transitioning into a joke.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Continuing to talk about his divorce on stage in the months that followed that Rolling Stones profile, during his Netflix special Chris Rock: Tamborine, he was very open once again. This time speaking about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more than just his infidelities</a>, Rock said that his marriage ended in part because he didn’t listen to his wife nearly enough during their time together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Rock Identifies The Struggles Of The Black Community In Terms Of Rich Vs. Wealth</a></span></p><h2 id=moving-on>Moving On</h2><p>Since Chris Rock and his ex-wife put an end to their romantic relationship, they have continued to be a big part of one another’s lives. After all, the couple had two daughters together during their many years together. Based on how Rock has talked about his divorce in public, you may assume that the exes working out a custody plan would have been pretty cut and dry. However, that certainly wasn’t the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to documents that Chris Rock filed during the process of his divorce, at one point his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ex-wife was keeping their two kids away</a> from him. Of course, it should go without saying that anyone would find it very difficult to suddenly not be able to see the people you love most in the world.</p><p>According to a statement that Rock’s ex-wife put out through her lawyers; she was “disappointed that Chris has accused her of keeping their children from him, which he knows is untrue and can be so easily disproved." No matter how things were playing out behind the scenes at that time, from all accounts it seems like Chris and his ex have since worked out a co-parenting plan.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Rock Reveals Why He's So Unapproachable</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqSRlrhur86mp62nnmK%2FsK%2FKZpqhqpmoerO7wqRknrBdrLansYydoK%2BnopiybrLAnKusZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmalaak-compton-rock-chris-rock-ex-wife-divorce-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmalaak-compton-rock-chris-rock-ex-wife-divorce-facts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmalaak-compton-rock-chris-rock-ex-wife-divorce-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmalaak-compton-rock-chris-rock-ex-wife-divorce-facts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmalaak-compton-rock-chris-rock-ex-wife-divorce-facts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmalaak-compton-rock-chris-rock-ex-wife-divorce-facts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./greta-thunberg-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./greta-thunberg-net-worth.html>What Is Greta Thunbergs Net Worth in 2022?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./vinessa-shaw.html>Vinessa Shaw</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./vinessa-shaw.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
