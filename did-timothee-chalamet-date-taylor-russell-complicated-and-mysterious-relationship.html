However, this is no ordinary young adult romance... The characters are cannibals who randomly meet each other and begin dating. The movie definitely got a lot of attention when it was announced thanks to the flashy and dramatic premise. But once people had a chance to watch it, they were impressed by Chalamet and Russell's performances and the chemistry between them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Taylor Russell liked working with Timothee Chalamet</a>, which led fans to ask if the co-stars were more than friends.

But while Chalamet and Russell definitely got along, did they actually date each other?</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deuxmoi reported on a relationship</a> between the Bones And All co-stars. According to a Reddit thread started by @32Wicky, DeuxMoi said that they were together. However, DeuxMoi then said that this wasn't true at all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/timoth-e-chalamet-and-taylor-russell-in-bones-and-all-via-collider.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Redditor wrote, "Deuxmoi mentioned on her podcast last week that she was told that Timothée and Taylor actually dated or hooked up for awhile but that ended. Things were awkward when they were both at Paris Fashion Week, and Kylie Jenner was also there and he and Kylie were seeing each other at that point."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Happy Birthday, Timothee Chalamet! Here's A Look At The Star's Best Performances On The Big Screen</a></span></p><p>The fan continued, "Fast forward to this week’s episode and she said she made a mistake with the info she received because she had to retract a lot of things and misinterpreted it. Now she’s saying Timothée and Taylor didn’t date or hook up at all, and things were awkward between them at Paris Fashion Week because the movie they were in together didn’t do that well."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That last comment must be referring to the box office numbers for Bones And All, which aren't that great. The movie grossed over $15 million and IMDb says that the budget was at least $16 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-russell.jpg><p>The Redditor wasn't sure why there were two different stories. It's definitely confusing.</p><p>According to J-14, people were convinced that Timothee Chalamet And Taylor Russell were together because they seemed interested in each other while attending the Venice Film Festival. J-14 quoted the original DeuxMoi submission that said “rising movie superstar renowned for dating his fair share of [nepotism] offspring and costars had a brief relationship with his colead during the making of their latest movie.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People thought that this sounded like Timothee Chalamet since he has had many relationships.</p><p>According to Your Tango, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Russell and Chalamet's alleged relationship</a> was casual. The source who wrote to DeuxMoi said "They've been in touch since filming and hooked up a few times but nothing too serious."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Johnny Depp Feels About Timothee Chalamet Playing A Young Willy Wonka</a></span></p><p>While the co-stars definitely worked closely together on the Bones And All set, there is no concrete, real proof that they definitely dated.

Russell seems to keep who she's dating more private than some other actors do.</p><p>While Just Jared Jr. published an article asking if Russell was once in a relationship with Lucas Hedges, she doesn't seem to have ever spoken about it. Chalamet doesn't always comment on who people think he's dating.</p><p>However, when people noticed that he was dating Lily-Rose Depp a few years ago, he did share how he felt about all the attention. The former couple was on an Italian vacation and paparazzi photos caused a stir. Chalamet told GQ, "then people are like: This is a P.R. stunt. A P.R. stunt?! Do you think I’d want to look like that in front of all of you?!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/timoth-e-chalamet.jpg><p>Chalamet and Russell seem to want to keep the spotlight on their movie. In a video interview with MTV UK, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actors discussed Bones And All</a>. They laughed a lot and appeared to get along great.</p><p>The main characters in Bones And All, Maren and Lee, are teenagers during the 1980s and don't have cell phones or social media. The conversation turned to living in a world without social media, and Chalamet praised his co-star. He said, "You said it so beautifully yesterday." She asked what she said and he replied, "something about the beauty of boredom." Russell laughed and said that "It's exciting to watch characters who are bored."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/did-timothee-chalamet-actually-date-taylor-russell_-here-s-the-truth-about-their-complicated-and-mysterious-relationship.jpg><p>While today's world offers up constant information and entertainment, things were different in the '80s, and that setting makes Bones And All particularly fascinating. It seems that the actors liked that the movie was set in this time period.

It doesn't seem that the actors want to talk about the rumors and make a statement either way.</p><p>At least new fans can keep discovering Bones And All. While it's definitely true that the premise is a little intense, everyone will likely be amazed by the hard work that the actors put into the film. They really committed to the roles and should be very proud.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqbauu9OhnJ5lk52ura3MnqtmnJGpsm7AwLKjqKpdp8K0v8Slo2abn6K9rbXCmquenF2Wu6V5zLKqrZ2inry2v4yrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-timothee-chalamet-date-taylor-russell-complicated-and-mysterious-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-timothee-chalamet-date-taylor-russell-complicated-and-mysterious-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-timothee-chalamet-date-taylor-russell-complicated-and-mysterious-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-timothee-chalamet-date-taylor-russell-complicated-and-mysterious-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-timothee-chalamet-date-taylor-russell-complicated-and-mysterious-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-timothee-chalamet-date-taylor-russell-complicated-and-mysterious-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dwayne-johnsons-ballers-was-sued-for-200-million-heres-what-happened.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dwayne-johnsons-ballers-was-sued-for-200-million-heres-what-happened.html>Dwayne Johnson's Ballers Was Sued For $200 Million.
