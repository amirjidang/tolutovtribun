This has made a popular platform for the media industry to make a buck entertaining the masses.</p><p class=align-left>Some listen to the music, but others cannot wait for their favourite presenters in various segments or shows. In Kenya, radio stations have certain unique hosts that have become a staple, mainly in the morning.
