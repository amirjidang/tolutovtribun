She's famous for her solo career as well as her work with Destiny's Child. She also recently took over the Superbowl Half Time Show.</p><h2 id=beyonce-s-childhood><strong>&nbsp;Beyonce's Childhood</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyonce was born by her full name, <a title="BeyoncÃ© Net Worth" href=#>Beyonce Giselle Knowles</a>, on September 4th, 1981. She was born to Tina and Matthew Knowles in Houston, Texas. She also has a younger sister named Solange. Her parents enrolled her at St.Mary's Elementary School, which is where she started singing and dancing. After being put in Parker Elementary school, she joined the choir for the school and started performing whenever she could.</p><p>Throughout her time in school, she sang and performed anywhere she could. She even won local contests for her talents and made a name for herself in the area. Beyonce graduated from Alief Elsik High School and also sang for her local church choir as a solo singer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=beyonce-s-career><strong>Beyonce's Career</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Local auditions for a singing group prompted Knowles to go audition with her friend Kelly Rowland. During their time there, they met LaTavia Roberson, who was also auditioning. All three of them were made into a group with a few other girls to make Girl's Tyme. Soon after this, the group was offered to be a part of Star Search, which was a talent show. Although they did not win, this prompted Beyonce's father to quit his job so that he could manage the singing group full time.</p><p>Unfortunately this change caused her family to struggle financially and resulted in each parent living in a separate apartment. After two girls were removed from the group, they renamed themselves Destiny's Child. Beyonce's mother even made costumes for the girls to wear when performing at various gigs. After being signed to Elektra Records, Beyonce's parents thought it best to move to Atlanta to work on the record. Unfortunately the record company cut them and the parents separated soon after. Then, in 1995, Grass Roots Entertainment signed them followed by Columbia Records signing them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The hit "Killing Time" was the first song that Destiny's Child released in 1997, after they had signed with Columbia Records. This song actually ended up being featured on the soundtrack to the movie Men in Black. The success with this long led to the release of their album, which was named after their group. From here, they released the song "No,No,No", which won them several awards. The second album they released went multi-platinum and had several number-one hits that topped Billboard charts.</p><p>Roberson and Luckett, the other two members of Destiny's Child, eventually disagreed with the manager, which prompted him to replace them with Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin. This happened right after the group won a Grammy Award, which forced Beyonce into depression for two years. After only five months in the group, Franklin left and the group consisted of just Beyonce, Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The group continued to record chart-topping singles and albums, but later split in 2001 so each member could pursue their own solo careers. In 2002 Beyonce made an appearance in Austin Powers in Goldmember while she recorded her first solo album. In 2003 she went on tour as a solo artist, but performed alongside other successful female artists. She continued to release albums on her own, and even went on tour with Destiny's Child after releasing their final album. In 2005 it was officially announced that the band would disband, which meant Beyonce could focus on her solo career.</p><p>Beyonce has continued to release hit albums and has even been in lead roles in several films. She's also known as "Sasha Fierce", which is her alter-ego from her third album. In 2013 Beyonce was invited to sing at the President's second inauguration and she also performed at the Super Bowl XLVII, where she took over the entire halftime show. Soon after this, she released a documentary about her life, much of which she filmed herself. Her fifth album is due to be released soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fast-facts-about-beyonce><strong>Fast Facts about Beyonce</strong></h2><p><strong></strong><strong>Beyonce's Income</strong></p><p>Beyonce brings in an estimated $40 million dollars per year, which doesn't include her husband's income.</p><p><strong>Beyonce's Net Worth</strong></p><p>The estimated net worth of Beyonce is around $300 million dollars.</p><p><strong>Beyonce's Hobbies and Spending Habits</strong></p><p>Beyonce enjoys traveling all around the world, but her busy schedule takes up a lot of her time.
