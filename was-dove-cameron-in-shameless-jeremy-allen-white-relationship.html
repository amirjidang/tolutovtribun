Now that White has achieved heartthrob status in Hollywood thanks to his role as Carmy Berzatto on The Bear, that could mean that Cameron couldn't help but have a little crush while they worked together...</p><h2 id=was-dove-cameron-in-shameless>Was Dove Cameron In Shameless?</h2><p>Dove Cameron starred in Shameless in 2012, which was the first time that she was cast in a TV series. She was a teenager at the time and it must have been really exciting to find out that she got the part. After starring in one episode of Malibu County and The Mentalist, Cameron began playing Maddie and Liv Rooney on Liv And Maddie, a role she would play from 2013 to 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shameless-dove-cameron-jeremy-allen-white.jpg><p>Dove Cameron played Holly Herkimer in two season 2 episodes of Shameless: episode 4 called "A Beautiful Mess" and episode 5 called "Father's Day."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Dove Cameron's Singing Career 'Comeback' Mean She'll Stop Acting For Good?</a></span></p><p>After Dove Cameron played Holly in season 2 of Shameless, she was replaced by Danika Yarosh, who played the role in seasons 4 and 5. When Holly comes back after being absent for quite a few episodes, she spends time with Lip's sister Debbie Gallagher, who is a terrible influence on her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's not clear why Dove Cameron was replaced on Shameless. The actress didn't mention this in any interviews. However, in 2015, Yarosh told Starry Mag that she did go to an audition for the role of Holly. She said, "When I originally auditioned for 'Shameless,' she was described as this experienced fifteen year old who is kind of helping Debbie (Emma Kenney) transition to the adult world, but they werenâ€™t really friends."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shameless-danika-yarosh.jpg><p>It's possible that Holly was only meant to be a minor character, and Dove Cameron signed a contract for two episodes. But then, when the writers decided to bring Holly back, they might have decided that they wanted another actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They might have also wanted Cameron to reprise her role, but the timing might not have worked out. Since Holly came back in season 4 of Shameless, which aired in 2011, this seems to have conflicted with Liv And Maddie.</p><p>Liv And Maddie and Shameless are definitely the two most famous shows that Cameron starred in. After these shows were over, she played Mal in the Disney film franchise The Descendants. While she had a few other parts, nothing made the same impression that Liv And Maddie and Shameless Did. In 2023, though, the actress played Anastasia Romanov in several episodes of History of the World, Part II.</p><h2 id=how-did-dove-cameron-feel-about-her-shameless-co-star-jeremy-allen-white>How Did Dove Cameron Feel About Her Shameless Co-Star Jeremy Allen White?</h2><p>Dove Cameron hasn't said anything about her Shameless co-star Jeremy Allen White. Since she played Holly early on in her career, she doesn't seem to have talked much about this character at all. Her interviews are mostly focused on Liv And Maddie, which of course makes sense since that is the TV show that made her super famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jeremy-allen-white.jpg><p>While Dove Cameron only played Holly in two episodes of Shameless, she was memorable. Her character Holly Herkimer is romantically interested in Lip Gallagher and flirts with him constantly Lip tells Holly that they can't sleep together at a birthday gathering that is held for Debbie. Lip knows that Holly is too young for him and that this wouldn't be a good idea.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jeremy Allen White Had Mixed Feelings About Emmy Rossum Leaving The Cast Of Shameless</a></span></p><p>Since Dove Cameron and Jeremy Allen White worked closely together, she must have formed an opinion of the actor. White's The Bear co-stars have only ever said nice things about him, and it's hard to imagine that Cameron wouldn't have had a good experience acting opposite him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jeremy-allen-white-keeps-his-body-ripped-with-an-intense-workout-routine-and-diet.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dove Cameron doesn't talk about her dating life</a>, though. In 2021, she said in an interview with Entertainment Tonight and said that while she would share before, she decided that she wasn't going to do that anymore. She said, "It's not out of fear, I never do anything out of fear... It's not even [that] I don't want anyone to be able to comment. I truly don't. I don't notice those things. I don't look for them. I'm not traumatized by people's opinions," she said. "It doesn't feel natural to share.

She said, "My earliest years in the industry were some of the best years of my life, while also being some of my worst and an unbelievable uphill battle. I definitely had a lot of fun, experimenting with who I was, what my abilities were, falling in love for the first time, and navigating this entirely new world that I was now, all of a sudden, involved in."</p><p>Cameron mentioned that she was dating someone in a less than ideal situation, she had "anxiety relating to newfound fame and global attention," she had eating disorders, and her dad passed away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dove-cameron-jeremy-allen-white-shameless.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As she told Create & Cultivate, she feels that she went through what she did because of the lessons that she learned.
