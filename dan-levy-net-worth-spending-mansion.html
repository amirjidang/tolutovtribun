However, there have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a lot of stars who’ve gone broke</a> due to their poor financial planning. As a result, a new star like Dan Levy needs to be careful about how he handles his newfound riches.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately for Dan Levy, he has a close relationship with his dad. Since Eugene Levy is a comedy legend, he should be able to give his son great advice on how to handle being rich. Of course, no matter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how close Eugene and Dan Levy are</a>, a lot of children don’t like to listen to the advice their parents give them. With all of that in mind, it begs an obvious question, what has Dan Levy been spending his money on now that he has an enormous net worth?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eugene Levy Supporting Dan On 'SNL' Is Too Wholesome To Handle</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amassing-a-fortune>Amassing A Fortune</h2><p>After watching his father’s show business career throughout his childhood, Dan Levy seemingly decided to follow in his dad’s footsteps. After getting a job working for MTV Canada during its short-lived existence, Levy started to make a bit of a name for himself as the co-host of The Hills: The After Show and The City: Live After Show.</p><p>After toiling away in the entertainment business for several years, Dan Levy approached his dad about creating the show that would become Schitt’s Creek. After debuting in 2015, Schitt’s Creek didn’t garner much attention during its first few seasons but it attracted enough viewers to stay on the air. Ultimately, that would prove to be a great thing as Schitt's Creek suddenly became a huge hit following its third season. The reason for that is the show started to stream on Netflix and millions of people discovered it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once Schitt’s Creek became a runaway hit, Dan Levy was able to cash in. After all, since Levy was one of Schitt's Creek creators, executive producers, showrunners, and stars, it seems safe to assume he got a nice piece of the pie. On top of that, Levy has signed an overall production deal with ABC Studios and he took a role in the 2021 rom-com Happiest Season. As a result of all those revenue streams, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Levy has a $14 million fortune</a> according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Was Dan Levy Before 'Schitt's Creek'?</a></span></p><h2 id=dan-s-huge-purchase>Dan’s Huge Purchase</h2><p>When most people become rich, one of the first things they buy is an expensive living space. While he can’t afford the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wildly expensive real estate</a> that some stars buy, Dan Lavy spent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4.1 million on an incredible Los Feliz estate</a> in 2020. Of course, given the fact that Levy spent millions on his home, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that it is impressive. After all, according to variety.com, Levy actually paid $400,000 above his home’s original asking price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As it turns out, Dan Levy’s two-story home is about 3,200 square feet and it contains four bedrooms and three bathrooms. More importantly, according to variety.com’s description, Levy’s home sounds absolutely gorgeous. For example, they describe the house as having a “Norma Desmond-worthy stone curved staircase”, a “huge fireplace”, and an “intimately proportioned den with slim wood beams across the ceiling. From there, the article describes a “snazzily revamped kitchen” with “slim marble countertops on chic”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of the main part of Dan Levy’s home, the property also has a two-car garage. While that may not sound overly impressive, it is noteworthy that there is a guesthouse on top of the garage and it boasts “an up-to-date bathroom”.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look At Keanu Reeves' Beverly Hills Mansion</a></span></p><h2 id=smaller-purchases>Smaller Purchases</h2><p>In June 2021, Rashida Jones and Dany Levy had a conversation on camera to help promote Citi’s new product, the Custom Cash Card. At one point during their conversation, Levy revealed that he’d spent money taking a yearly trip to Japan. While on one of those trips, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Levy dropped some cash on something unusual</a>, “a bag that you put on your foot and it makes all the skin on your foot shed”.</p><p>According to Dan Levy, using the foot shedding bag he bought in Japan was a strange experience. “It was so disturbing to participate in. It’s just a plastic bag that you put on your foot and within the following weeks, your foot sheds. So, that’s how I’m spending my money.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of the money that Dan Levy has spent on foot care, it seems very clear that a good portion of his cash goes to one of his passions, fashion. After all, Levy can always be seen in extremely fashionable clothes, and keeping up with the latest trends gets expensive very quickly. Of course, it is safe to assume that Levy has gotten some of his clothes for free, especially the duds he sports at major events. Despite that, designers usually provide high-end clothes to a star like Dan Levy but that would still mean that he has to spend his own cash on his day-to-day outfits.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Schitt's Creek's Dan Levy Was A Terrible Red Carpet Correspondent</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqZdobK3xYynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMrKeeppSeu6h5zJqlrKGfo3w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdan-levy-net-worth-spending-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdan-levy-net-worth-spending-mansion.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdan-levy-net-worth-spending-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdan-levy-net-worth-spending-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdan-levy-net-worth-spending-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdan-levy-net-worth-spending-mansion.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tory-burch-large-totes-purses-on-sale-our-picks.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tory-burch-large-totes-purses-on-sale-our-picks.html>Tory Burch Has So Many Large Totes and Purses on Sale Our Picks</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-calvin-klein-success-story-heres-how-it-became-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-fashion-houses.html>The Calvin Klein Story: Here's How It Became One Of The World's Biggest Fashion Houses</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-calvin-klein-success-story-heres-how-it-became-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-fashion-houses.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
