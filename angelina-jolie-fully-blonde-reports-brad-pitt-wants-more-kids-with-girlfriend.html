So much so, it sounds like the actor is hoping to expand his family with his girlfriend.</p><p>Angelina made a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recent appearance at her Atelier Jolie boutique located in New York City,</a> where she showcased her freshly dyed blonde hair. The 48-year-old actress looked elegant in an all-black ensemble featuring a jacket, bootcut pants, and a white t-shirt.

She’s been working on launching the fashion house Atelier Jolie since last year, <a href=#>even crediting several of the children she shares with Brad Pitt</a> for helping her bring the vision to life.</p><p>“I don’t want to be a big fashion designer. I want to build a house for other people to become that,” Angelina told Vogue about the physical space. “I’ve met a lot of artisans over the years—very capable, talented people—and I’d like to see them grow.”</p><p>She said it was her 19-year old son Pax who helped design the brand’s logo, while her eldest daughter, Zahara, 18, was a key player in helping her choose the New York space.</p><p>“I can be very impulsive, but Zahara is so grounded, decisive, and thoughtful,” the Maleficent said. “When she agreed, I felt we were both decided.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Angelina clearly has a close bond with her kids, reports say Brad’s relationship has been strained with them since their 2016 divorce. Recent reports have said that while he’s hopeful about repairing the bond, he’s also focusing on the future, including he what he can create with his current girlfriend, Ines.</p><h2 id=brad-reportedly-wants-to-have-children-with-ines-de-ramon>Brad Reportedly Wants To Have Children With Ines De Ramon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/brad-pitt-ines-de-ramon.jpg><p>The couple have been relatively private about their relationship, but reports say <a href=#>Ines and Brad have discussed marriage and children</a>.</p><p>“Brad and Ines are smitten with each other and she recently moved into his Los Feliz mansion, proving how serious they are,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an insider told Closer Magazine</a>. “He’s known from the outset that Ines wants to become a mum and that’s something they discussed very early on, given their 30-year age gap.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They noted that Ines was initially “surprised” by Brad’s “willingness to become a dad again, but he insisted it was something he very much wants too.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/A-scene-from-Once-Upon-a-Time-In-Hollywood-featuring-Brad-Pitt-and-Leonardo-DiCaprio-via-The-New-York-Times.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Brad Pitt Vs Leonardo DiCaprio: Which Star Has A Higher Net Worth?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are essentially A-lister competitors, but whose net worth is more impressive?</span><p>“After everything he’s been through with his children, he’s keen to make a fresh start and create new memories,” they went on. “Brad’s not getting any younger, so it’s something they would like sooner rather than later. He’s even joked about doing the school run in his 70s and hopes that he’ll still be seen as a heartthrob!"</p><p>Angelina and Brad were married for two years, from 2014 to 2016, after a relationship that began in 2005. The couple famously met on the set of their film Mr. & Mrs. Smith in 2004, while Pitt was still married to actress Jennifer Aniston.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During their relationship, Angelina and Brad welcomed their children through a combination of adoption and biological birth.
