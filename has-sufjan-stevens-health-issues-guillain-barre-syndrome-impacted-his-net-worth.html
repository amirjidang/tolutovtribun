But while the wait is almost over, Stevens has recently shared that he is dealing with some health challenges. Here's what is going on with the beloved singer and whether his health is affecting his impressive career.</p><h2 id=what-health-problem-does-sufjan-stevens-have>What Health Problem Does Sufjan Stevens Have?</h2><p>In 2022, <a href=#>Jenna Jameson had health problems</a>, and she was told that she could have Guillain-Barré Syndrome. She was having trouble walking, which is one of the main indications that someone has this disease. This is also something that Sufjan Stevens has been dealing with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sufjan-stevens-5.jpg><p>In September 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sufjan Stevens shared that he has Guillain-Barré Syndrome</a>. According to People, he shared a photo on Instagram where he was using a wheelchair. His fans had no idea that he was struggling, and it was a heartbreaking image.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Steve Harwell Quietly Retired From Smash Mouth In 2021, But His Health Issues Started Years Before</a></span></p><p>The singer explained to his fans, “Hi Friends. Quick update on my life. I’m very excited about having new music to share, but I just wanted to let you know that one of the reasons why I haven’t been able to participate in the press and promotion leading up to the release of Javelin is bc I am in the hospital."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continued, "Last month I woke up one morning and couldn’t walk. My hands, arms and legs were numb and tingling and I had no strength, no feeling, no mobility. My brother drove me to the ER and after a series of tests — MRIs, EMGs, cat scans, X-rays, spinal taps (!), echo-cardiograms, etc. — the neurologists diagnosed me with an autoimmune disorder called Guillain-Barré Syndrome.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sufjan-stevens-2.jpg><p>He shared that when he went to the hospital and was told that he had this condition, he was in bed at home for a period of two weeks. It sounds like a terrifying time. He also wrote he is "undergoing intensive physical therapy/occupational therapy, strength building etc to get my body back in shape and to learn to walk again."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also wrote on Instagram, "It’s a slow process, but they say I will ‘recover,’ it just takes a lot of time, patience and hard work. Most people who have GBS learn to walk again on their own within a year, so I am hopeful … I’m committed to getting better, I’m in good spirits, and I’m surrounded by a really great team.”</p><h2 id=how-has-guillain-barr-eacute-syndrome-affected-sufjan-stevens-39-net-worth>How Has Guillain-Barré Syndrome Affected Sufjan Stevens' Net Worth?</h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Sufjan Stevens has a net worth of $4 million. Since he has made nine albums since his 2000 debut "A Sun Came," that number might be lower than people would think. However, it's still high, and that will give him a cushion as he figures out his next steps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sufjan-stevens.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since suffering from a health issue like Guillain-Barré Syndrome makes it tricky to keep touring, it's likely that Sufjan Stevens will have to take some time away from his music career in order to heal and figure out how to live with the condition.</p><p>Stevens explained in his Instagram post that "Javelin" is coming out on October 6th, 2023, he isn't able to get out in public and talk about it. For an artist who loves connecting with his fanbase and sharing what he has created, this is absolutely terrible.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Randy Travis' Health Issues Changed His Life And Career Forever, Here's What He's Really Doing Now</a></span></p><p>Stevens told his fans that the disease has made it so he can't walk right now. That definitely makes it challenging to market an album and go on tour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Stevens explained that he is working hard to recover, it does seem that it could be a slow process. It might be a year or so before he can go out on tour to support his new album. He would miss out on some money from this income stream.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sufjan-stevens-3.jpg><p>However, since fans will still be purchasing Sufjan Stevens's new album, he will still make some money from that.</p><p>How much money the singer can make definitely depends on when he will be able to walk. According to The Mayo Clinic, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">disease Guillain-Barre syndrome</a> can cause death, and even if someone regains the ability to walk, they could have "weakness, numbness or fatigue" still. The publication reported that it's absolutely possible to get over it, though, and some can walk within a six-month period of learning that they have the condition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sufjan-stevens-christmas-songs.jpg><p>Stevens sounded optimistic at the end of his Instagram post. He finished his message to his fans by writing, "I’ll keep you posted as I progress. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers. And a huge shout out to all the incredible caretakers of the world working night and day to help us heal. They are living saints. Be well, be joyful, stay sane, stay safe. I love you. yours truly from a wheelchair XOXOXO Sufjan Stevens."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Pink Has Been Battling A Threatening Health Issue Since Her Childhood</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sufjan Stevens is a musician who truly cares about his work. He wants to express his creativity and show the world. In interviews, he makes it clear that he isn't after money or fame. In 2020, he spoke to The Guardian and said, “I don’t need to be famous or sell millions of records. There’s never a conversation with myself about how I’m advancing my profile.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sufjan-stevens-4.jpg><p>In 2018, when his song "Mystery of Love" was used in the movie Call Me By My Name, he received a Best Original Song Oscar nomination. Stevens sounded very humble when talking about it.</p><p>He told Variety, "Well, it is Hollywood [laughs], but it’s incredible to be part of this small project and that these small, quiet songs are being given a voice and given recognition on the scale of the Disneys and the Pixars and the “Star Wars”-es of our world. I think it’s pretty outrageous and amazing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqtdqMKntsCnZKyslauyr7%2BMoZyapKSdeqq%2F0q6crGWXqratuMCipWaakae%2FpnnSsqWdqp%2Bism61zKmYnKyVmXqptdJmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhas-sufjan-stevens-health-issues-guillain-barre-syndrome-impacted-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhas-sufjan-stevens-health-issues-guillain-barre-syndrome-impacted-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhas-sufjan-stevens-health-issues-guillain-barre-syndrome-impacted-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhas-sufjan-stevens-health-issues-guillain-barre-syndrome-impacted-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhas-sufjan-stevens-health-issues-guillain-barre-syndrome-impacted-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhas-sufjan-stevens-health-issues-guillain-barre-syndrome-impacted-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-4-8-billion-vessel-heres-what-makes-history-supreme-the-most-expensive-yacht-in-the-world.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-4-8-billion-vessel-heres-what-makes-history-supreme-the-most-expensive-yacht-in-the-world.html>Here's What Makes History Supreme The Most Expensive Yacht In The World</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gizelle-bryant-net-worth.html>Gizelle Bryant Net Worth How Much is Bryant Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gizelle-bryant-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
