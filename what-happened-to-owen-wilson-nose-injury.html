While some stars at those events will wear eye-catching clothes, the truth is that when you get a bunch of stars together, very few of them will stand out visually.The reason why it can be difficult for stars to stand out when they gather in a group is simple, most of them look a lot alike. Sure, the stars will look different in some ways but most of them will have one thing in common, they are unrealistically good-looking and they have near-perfect facial features.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Celebrities Are Totally Blind To The Resemblance They Have To Other Famous Stars</a></span>Since almost every star is implausibly good-looking, there are a lot of <a href=#>stars who could be twins even though they are not related</a>. On top of that, since most stars feel the pressure to have a perfect face, even an actor as good-looking as <a href=#>Tom Cruise has reportedly undergone plastic surgery</a>.In order for a star to stand out among their peers, all they have to do is embrace their imperfections the way Owen Wilson has with his nose. While many fans love that Wilson doesn't seem self-conscious about his nose, that doesn't mean that they aren't curious about what caused it to look like that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-owen-wilson-s-nose>What Happened To Owen Wilson's Nose?</h2><p>When people look back on Owen Wilson's career decades from now, they will likely be very impressed with everything he has accomplished.</p><p>An extremely popular comedic actor, Wilson has starred in several movies that millions of people love and have watched multiple times. On top of that, cinephiles will likely remember that <a href=#>Wilson co-wrote some of the movies that made him a star</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Owen Wilson Makes A Surprising Amount Of Money For This Catchphrase</a></span></p><p>Despite all of those accomplishments and the fact that Wilson is now part of the <a href=#>MCU</a>, there is no denying that two silly things are a big part of his legacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first silly but admittedly very entertaining thing about Wilson that will likely be remembered is his popular catchphrase, "wow". After all, Wilson says "wow" in such a uniquely musical way that fans simply can't get enough of him saying that word.</p><p>The other thing that a lot of people will remember about Wilson is his distinctive nose. However, even though Wilson's nose has been a topic of discussion for many years, the fact is that many of his fans have no idea why he looks like that.</p><p>Since Wilson has been a movie star for many years, he has taken part in hundreds, if not thousands of interviews during his life. Unsurprisingly, the topic of Wilson's nose has come up in some of those interviews.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most notably, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wilson explained how he got his distinctive nose</a> during a 2001 Los Angeles Times interview.</p><p>As Wilson revealed during that interview, when he was a teen attending St. Mark's High School in Dallas, Texas, he was in a fight when he suffered an injury to his nose. However, since then, Wilson has described the fight as more akin to roughhousing with a friend.</p><p>As Wilson also revealed during the aforementioned 2001 interview, his nose got struck again when he was playing football in his youth. Those two injuries combined caused his nose to look the way it does now.</p><p>Many years later in 2022, Wilson took part in a Wired Autocomplete Interview in which he yet again explained what happened to his nose. At that time, he added a fascinating element to the story, the aforementioned game where he reinjured his nose was a flag football game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you know the story of what happened to Wilson's nose, it is amazing that he suffered two serious injuries during incidents that sound relatively innocent.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-jennifer-grey-s-nose>What Happened To Jennifer Grey's Nose?</h2><p>Years before people started talking about Owen Wilson's nose, there was another movie star who was discussed because of that part of their body.</p><p>In 1996 and 1997, Jennifer Grey starred in Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Dirty Dancing respectively. After both of those movies became hits that have gone down in history, many people thought Grey's career had a lot of potential.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Grey Absolutely Destroyed Her Career By Doing This</a></span></p><p>After Grey rose to fame, she decided to get a pair of rhinoplasty surgeries. If Grey got those nose jobs because she wanted to feel more self-confident, then that would have been great.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, Grey has revealed that she changed her nose after her mom advised her that doing so may make it easier for her to land roles. That said, it is important to note that Grey described her mom as loving and supportive in her memoir. Grey also made it clear that her mom always loved the way Jennifer looked, she was just trying to be pragmatic.</p><p>After Grey got her nose surgeries, many fans found her unrecognizable. In fact, even some of Grey's fans didn't recognize Jennifer when she appeared in the popular sitcom Friends.</p><p>Years later when Grey released her memoir, she wrote about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">regretting her rhinoplasty surgeries</a>. “Overnight, I lose my identity and my face,”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Grey also described the time an airport worker who had Jennifer's paperwork reacted to her name. “‘Oh, Jennifer Grey, like the actress.’” According to Grey, when she told the airport employee that she was the Dirty Dancing star, they refused to believe her. “‘I’ve seen ‘Dirty Dancing a dozen times. I know Jennifer Grey. And you are not her.’”</p><p>Based on what happened to Grey, it seems very clear that Owen Wilson has been wise to embrace his nose.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brvWnqVmr5mhwLC6jKemrJ1dnrurwdGyZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-owen-wilson-nose-injury.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-owen-wilson-nose-injury.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-owen-wilson-nose-injury.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-owen-wilson-nose-injury.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-owen-wilson-nose-injury.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-owen-wilson-nose-injury.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./phoozy-shark-tank.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./phoozy-shark-tank.html>Phoozy Shark Tank Founder, Net Worth, and Investment</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./noah-erb-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-57278-html.html>Noah Erb Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./noah-erb-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-57278-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
