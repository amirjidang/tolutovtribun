But he’s been winning people over with his good looks and charming smile since the 1980s, and he still looks as gorgeous as he did back in the day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But not everyone in Hollywood enjoys the actor’s company. In fact, some celebs would rather steer clear at the sight of him. So, here’s a list of VIPs who openly dislike Tom Cruise, and a few who love him no matter what.</p><p>Enjoy the article!</p><h2 id=adore---david-beckham><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Adore - David Beckham</span></h2><p>David Beckham and Tom Cruise are such good friends, that the sports star reportedly asked the actor for advice on his professional soccer career, according to The Guardian. And in 2019, the two of them were spotted drinking at Beckham’s favorite pub, The Cow, in Notting Hill.</p><h2 id=adore---zac-efron><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Adore - Zac Efron</span></h2><p>Back in 2010, Zac Efron was still reeling from the fame of “High School Musical,” but was still trying to break into Hollywood. And one day, Tom Cruise invited him to his home by asking, “You wanna learn how?” in relation to riding a motorcycle. According to Details Magazine, Cruise taught Efron how a motorcycle engine works and also showed him the dozens of bikes the actor owns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adore---dakota-fanning><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Adore - Dakota Fanning</span></h2><p>Dakota Fanning played Tom Cruise’s daughter in “War of the Worlds” when she was 11. And to this day, the actor continues to send her a special birthday gift every year which she thinks is a beautiful gesture. She wonders if he’s ever going to stop. But According to Fanning, Cruise is her “lifelong friend.”</p><h2 id=adore---cameron-crowe><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Adore - Cameron Crowe</span></h2><p>Director Cameron Crowe worked with Tom in “Jerry Maguire.” Since then, they’ve had a pretty strong friendship. But when Crowe needed a bit of encouragement to stay in Hollywood, Cruise was on hand to introduce him to director Judd Apatow, who’s a fan of Crowe’s film, “Say Anything.” The actor also gave Crowe a push to direct once again.</p><h2 id=adore---jonathan-lipnicki><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Adore - Jonathan Lipnicki</span></h2><p>Tom played Jonathan Lipnicki’s dad in the film “Jerry Maguire.” Of course, in those days, Lipnicki was an adorable little boy with glasses and spiked blonde hair who saw his onscreen dad as his mentor. In 2018, Cruise posted before and now photos of the actor and wrote, “They grow up so fast.” Then, Lipnicki wrote back, "Working with you was great," he wrote to Cruise. "Getting trolled by you, even better."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dislike---mark-wahlberg><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Dislike - Mark Wahlberg</span></h2><p>According to TMZ, a series of leaked court documents suggested that Tom Cruise’s counsel had compared working on a film and not being there for Suri, as equivalent to fighting in Afghanistan. Cruise later denied hearing Afghanistan being mentioned but did say that in one of his movies it felt like it. Later down the line, Mark Wahlberg went to a Q&A and ranted about his disdain for actors who compare acting to being in a war, but didn’t name Cruise specifically.</p><h2 id=dislike---brad-pitt><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Dislike - Brad Pitt</span></h2><p>Lestat and Louis weren’t always friendly in “Interview With the Vampire.” But according to Radar Online, neither are Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. When the movie came out, Pitt reportedly claimed he was miserable while filming the vampire movie and said, “There came a point during filming when I started really resenting him. He’s North Pole, I’m South.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dislike---john-gruden><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Dislike - John Gruden</span></h2><p>In 2018, Raiders coach John Gruden reportedly told NFL guru Peter King, “Well, I never thought Tom Cruise, never thought his movies were any good, but he’s making plenty of money.” While his exact reasons for dissing Cruise were not made clear, it was apparently an attempt to shake off the label that the coach was being overpaid.</p><h2 id=dislike---south-park-producers><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Dislike - South Park Producers</span></h2><p>Trey Parker, Matt Stone, and the producers of South Park were not happy when Tom Cruise threatened to sue them. Then again, they did depict him on an episode as a dad who thought one of his kids was the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. Then they ridiculed Cruise’s acting and suggested he was trapped in the closet.</p><h2 id=dislike---justin-bieber><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Dislike - Justin Bieber</span></h2><p>On June 9, 2019, Justin Bieber tweeted that he wanted to challenge Tom Cruise to fight in the octagon. But then he was quoted telling TMZ, "I think he would probably whoop my a** in a fight. He's got that dad strength." The pop star also admitted it was just a random tweet. But Cruise never commented on the challenge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dislike---victoria-beckham><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Dislike - Victoria Beckham</span></h2><p>Victoria and David Beckham were snapped various times hanging with Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes. After Holmes and Cruise split, rumors of a rift between Posh Spice and Cruise surfaced. But at The Vogue 100, all evidence suggested otherwise. In fact, she stated: “Myself and David have known Tom Cruise for quite a few years. We go out with Tom and talk about how is he and his latest films and what it’s like doing Mission Impossible.”</p><h2 id=dislike---john-travolta><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Dislike - John Travolta</span></h2><p>Tom Cruise and John Travolta aren’t feuding because of a woman or a major movie role. Their reported dislike for each other stems from the fact that they’re competitive about becoming elite members within a certain&nbsp;church, which they are both members of.</p><p>But Travolta is bitter that Cruise is allegedly chummier with David Miscavige, the head of the church. Hence the feud.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dislike---kirstie-alley><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Dislike -&nbsp;Kirstie Alley</span></h2><p>Leah Remini shared a lot of information in her memoir about celebrity Scientologists. In her book, Remini&nbsp;focuses on Kirstie Alley and her horrible relationship with Tom Cruise. "I had heard Tom didn't like them [Alley, and John Travolta]," News.au quoted Remini’s book. But she never shared why he disliked them so much.</p><h2 id=dislike---brooke-shields><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Dislike -&nbsp;Brooke Shields</span></h2><p>In 2006, Tom Cruise criticized Brook Shields for taking antidepressants to deal with her postpartum depression. As a Scientologist, his religion is against psychiatric care and the use of medications like antidepressants. And although he apologized to Shields, one of Cruise’s reps told the Associated Press that he hadn’t changed his stance on the subject.</p><h2 id=dislike---matt-lauer><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Dislike -&nbsp;Matt Lauer</span></h2><p>In 2005, Tom Cruise went on the Today show and got a little testy when host, Matt Lauer asked him if he could be with someone who wasn’t a Scientologist. At the time, Lauer was referring to Katie Holmes whom the actor was engaged to. He also brought up the feud with Shields to which Cruise got very tense and declared, “I’ve never agreed with psychiatry, ever.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dislike---kate-ceberano><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Dislike -&nbsp;Kate Ceberano</span></h2><p>In 2009, rumors circulated that Australian singer Kate Ceberano had met up with Tom Cruise and his then-wife Katie Holmes during their visit to Australia. And although Ceberano and Cruise are both Scientologists, she thinks it's crazy to assume they're friends. She said, "It's like [saying] every Catholic is good friends with the Pope." In other words, they are definitely not friends.</p><h2 id=dislike---nazanin-boniadi><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Dislike -&nbsp;Nazanin Boniadi</span></h2><p>Leah Remini also told RadarOnline that the church had ordered “Homeland” actress Nazanin Boniadi to leave her boyfriend to date Tom Cruise. She reportedly refused but Scientology leaders convinced her that her boyfriend was a cheater. So, she gave in and started dating Cruise. But then the A-list actor ended things without even telling her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dislike---david-miscavige><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Dislike - David Miscavige</span></h2><p>David Miscavige, the leader of the Church of Scientology, hasn’t always had a great relationship with the “Mission Impossible” actor. In fact, they reportedly had a bit of a fallout, which David’s father, Ronald might have played a role in. In Ronald’s memoir, he mentioned how his son had thrown the actor a party to get him to join the church. The leader lost it when Cruise arrived four hours late and then went straight to bed. But they later bonded over skeet shooting.</p><h2 id=dislike---leah-remini><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Dislike - Leah Remini</span></h2><p>In her memoir “Troublemaker,” Leah Remini was very candid about how she had witnessed his temper first hand. She also told RadarOnline about a time he blew up on an assistant whom he accused of improperly making cookie dough for the group to bake.</p><p>He also said she was beneath founder L. Rob Hubbard, church leader David Miscavige and himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinnqegobJuw8eoZKiolaO5unnDoqqloZuaerW7zGaaq62ZqLJurc2dZK2gn6iybsPHqGSanJ%2Bnsm60yKZm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpeople-who-openly-dislike-tom-cruise-and-those-who-adore-him.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpeople-who-openly-dislike-tom-cruise-and-those-who-adore-him.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpeople-who-openly-dislike-tom-cruise-and-those-who-adore-him.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpeople-who-openly-dislike-tom-cruise-and-those-who-adore-him.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpeople-who-openly-dislike-tom-cruise-and-those-who-adore-him.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpeople-who-openly-dislike-tom-cruise-and-those-who-adore-him.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./15-reasons-the-xfl-was-a-massive-failure-everyone-forgets-about.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./15-reasons-the-xfl-was-a-massive-failure-everyone-forgets-about.html>15 Reasons The XFL Was A Massive Failure Everyone Forgets About</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-celeb-deaths-related-to-the-illuminati.html>10 Celeb Deaths Related To The Illuminati</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-celeb-deaths-related-to-the-illuminati.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
