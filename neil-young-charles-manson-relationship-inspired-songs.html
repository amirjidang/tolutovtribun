Once he released "Heart of Gold" and "Harvest Moon," there was no stopping him from becoming even more successful.</p><p>Young has had an awe-inspiring career and has toured everywhere, released a ton of albums, and written the memoir "Waging Heavy Peace." In his book, <strong>Young wrote something memorable about a surprising figure: Charles Manson</strong>. <a href=#>Bryan Cranston shared a story about Charles Manson</a> that shocked his fans, and Neil Young's fanbase will also want to know what the singer had to say. In this article, we'll take a look at how Neil Young knew Charles Manson, and also the song that he wrote about the terrifying figure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-between-neil-young-and-charles-manson>What Happened Between Neil Young And Charles Manson?</h2><p>According to American Songwriter, Neil Young <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote about Charles Manson</a> in "Waging Heavy Peace." <a href=#>Young praised Taylor Swift's music</a> and also said that he thought that Manson had talent.</p><p><strong>In the 1960s, Neil Young met Charles Manson</strong> because they both knew Dennis Wilson from The Beach Boys. This was before Mason's horrible crimes and back when hoped that he could become a successful singer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bob-dylan-and-neil-young-are-friends-now-but-once-engaged-in-a-bitter-creative-feud.jpg><p>Young wrote that Manson's musical talents were similar to Bob Dylan's:</p><p>“After a while, a guy showed up, picked up my guitar, and started playing a lot of songs on it. His name was Charlie … Kind of like Dylan, but different because it was hard to glimpse a true message in them, but the songs were fascinating. He was quite good.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given everything that the world knows about Manson's crimes, it's definitely strange to hear these comments. According to Louder.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Young thought Manson was talented</a>. They didn't have a close friendship, and from what Young has said, it sounds like they talked about music quite a lot.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/neil-young-at-the-juno-awards-in-2011.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Bob Dylan And Neil Young Are Friends Now, But They Once Engaged In A Bitter Creative Feud</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Neil Young was once compared to Bob Dylan, sparking a short-lived feud that resulted in the two artists becoming close friends.</span><p>What Bands Has Neil Young Been Part Of?</p><ul><li>Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young</li><li>Crazy Horse</li></ul><p>According to Louder, Young said, “He had this kind of music that nobody else was doing. He would sit down with a guitar and start playing and making up stuff, different every time. It just kept comin’ out, comin’ out. Then he would stop and you would never hear that one again."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pegi-young-neil-young.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Young continued:</p><p>"Musically, I thought he was very unique. I thought he had something crazy, something great. He was like a living poet.”</p><p>According to Billboard, Neil Young attempted to convince Reprise Records to give Charles Manson a record deal, but that didn't work out. As many publications have noted, the two seemed to be at the same parties and be part of the same social circle. There's no evidence that they were actually friends, and it's important to note that Young has only said positive things about Manson's musical abilities, not anything else.</p><p>Neil Young's Most Popular Songs</p><ul><li>"Harvest Moon"</li><li>"Heart Of Gold"</li><li>"Rockin' in the Free World"</li><li>"Helpless"</li><li>"Old Man"</li><li>"Sugar Mountain"</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/neil-young.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Neil Young And Joni Mitchell Have Said About Their Battles With Polio</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The drama continues to unfold between Joe Rogan, Neil Young, and Spotify about the importance of vaccines, and Joni Mitchell is involved too.</span><p>Young doesn't seem to have commented on Manson's prison time or murder changes. Young knew Manson before these crimes took place. In 1969, the Manson Family killed Sharon Tate among with several other victims, and in 1971, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Manson was charged</a> with first-degree murder and sentenced to prison, according to Brittanica.com.</p><p>Times Neil Young Has Been Outspoken</p><ul><li>asked Spotify to take his music off the platform because of his association with Joe Rogan</li><li>didn't like that Beck sang a cover of "Old Man"</li><li>criticized Ticketmaster for high ticket prices</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the 1960s, Neil Young wasn't the household name that he is today, but he was working hard at his music career. Reprise Records released his debut album, "Neil Young," in 1968. In 1969, Neil Young and Crazy Horse's album "Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere" was released. By the end of the 1970s, Young would be a massive rock star with many successful albums. As time went on, he became an even bigger part of the music industry and has won the respect and praise of critics, fans, and other musicians.</p><h2 id=neil-young-wrote-the-song-quot-revolution-blues-quot-about-charles-manson>Neil Young Wrote The Song "Revolution Blues" About Charles Manson</h2><p><strong>Neil Young's song "Revolution Blues" was </strong>on his 1974 album "On The Beach"<strong> </strong>and was <strong>about Charles Manson's crimes</strong>. The lyrics are intense and paint a picture of the unnerving vibe that was in California at the time.</p><p>Young wrote in his song: "Well, I'm a barrel of laughs, with my carbine on/I keep 'em hoppin', till my ammunition's gone/But I'm still not happy/I feel like there's something wrong." The song continues:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I got the revolution blues, I see bloody fountains/And ten million dune buggies comin' down the mountains/Well, I hear that Laurel Canyon is full of famous stars/But I hate them worse than lepers and I'll kill them in their cars."</p><p>Young doesn't seem to have said much about this specific song, perhaps because he expressed everything he wanted to say in the lyrics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If Neil Young did talk about "Revolution Blues," he would likely say the same thing that he has said in the past about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how he writes his popular and smart songs</a>. He told Zane Lowe of Apple Music 1 that he will "disappear" when working.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Musicians Who Inspired Neil Young</a> (According to Far Out Magazine)</p><ul><li>Keith Richards</li><li>Mick Jagger</li><li>Joni Mitchell</li><li>Bob Dylan</li><li>Paul McCartney</li><li>Kurt Cobain</li></ul><p>He explained, “I don’t even know. It just happens. I just never not do it. If it’s happening, it’s happening. Everything else stops. That’s the most important thing. So if you want to do that, if you want to write songs, when the song comes to you, you got to stop everything else. No matter what you’re doing, you just leave and you just go somewhere and pick up on what it was you got.”</p><p>Of course, "Revolution Blues" isn't Neil Young's only song about something political or controversial. His song "Ohio" refers to the 1970 shootings at Kent State, and "Rockin' in the Free World" is about George H. W. Bush.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilnqGcYsawwc2gZJygkae5pr%2BMppinq5%2BjerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIyipayomaeypXnSqKWgq18%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fneil-young-charles-manson-relationship-inspired-songs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fneil-young-charles-manson-relationship-inspired-songs.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fneil-young-charles-manson-relationship-inspired-songs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fneil-young-charles-manson-relationship-inspired-songs.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fneil-young-charles-manson-relationship-inspired-songs.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fneil-young-charles-manson-relationship-inspired-songs.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./new-girls-jake-johnson-explains-how-he-gets-twin-daughters-to-eat.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./new-girls-jake-johnson-explains-how-he-gets-twin-daughters-to-eat.html>New Girls Jake Johnson Explains How He Gets Twin Daughters to Eat</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-top-10-most-beautiful-women-celebrities-in-lebanon.html>Most Beautiful Women Celebrities in Lebanon</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-top-10-most-beautiful-women-celebrities-in-lebanon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
