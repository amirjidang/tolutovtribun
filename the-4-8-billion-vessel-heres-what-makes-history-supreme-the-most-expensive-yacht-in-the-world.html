As such, it's possible that in 2011, an unidentified Malaysian, reported to be<a href=#> business billionaire Robert Kuok</a>, may have gone to the top of the pack by purchasing History Supreme, a yacht composed of solid gold, platinum, meteoric stone, and a tyrannosaurus rex bone. Kuok is the self-made billionaire who runs the Kuok Group, an international corporation with operations all over the world. He reportedly spent a third of his $12.8 billion fortune when he paid $4.8 billion for the History Supreme. It's estimated that the 97-year-old will have a net worth of $12.6 billion by 2021, according to Forbes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gold-plated rooms are the norm on boats, where every luxury is taken care of for their guests. There are numerous swimming pools, dance floors, cinema halls, bars, and lounges, as well as a variety of other amenities for the billionaires who own these wonders of architectural design. But that's not all; owners board in helicopters that land on the deck of the boat for added panache. One of the world's top engines powers each yacht, which is a sleek and attractive craft. No one on board notices a jot of discomfort as they soar through the waves at top speed. In order to ensure that their sheen and durability are worth the price tag, the ships are built using the best materials available.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="What Makes Stuart Hughes Diamond Edition The Most Expensive Suit In The World" href=#>What Makes Stuart Hughes Diamond Edition The Most Expensive Suit In The World</a></span></p><h2 id=supreme-history-is-a-boat-made-of-gold>Supreme History Is A Boat Made of Gold</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">History Supreme&nbsp;is the most expensive</a> boat in the world. A Malaysian businessman, who wishes to remain unknown, commissioned Stuart Hughes to create it. According to media reports, the guy is Robert Kuok, the billionaire creator of Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts. When finished, the 30-meter yacht took three years to build and required about 100,000 kilograms of solid gold and platinum. On the boat's base, a thin film of gold metal has been applied to give it a luxurious look. The deck, dining area, railings, and even the anchor all feature a touch of gold trim. As one example of the yacht's lavish interior design, the major sleeping quarter&nbsp;features a T-Rex bone set on a meteoric stone wall.</p><p>A remarkable 220,462 pounds of precious metals were used during the vessel's three-year construction, according to the Daily Mail. It was all gold and platinum: the base of the boat, the deck, dining area, rails, and anchor. As Roman Abramovitch spent ten times as much for Eclipse, it has been believed that Robert Kuok bought the superyacht. <a href=#>The Forbes billionaires' list</a> ranks Kuok as one of only three Malaysians with a net worth of $5 billion or more. The most likely bidder is Robert Kuok, the wealthiest man in Malaysia, with a net worth of $12.5 billion, according to the Business Insider.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=history-supreme-s-luxurious-interiors-and-performance>History Supreme's Luxurious Interiors And Performance</h2><p>There are precious metals used in the eating room, rails, and anchors; the vessel's base is covered in pure gold. In the superyacht's luxurious interior, there are central sleeping quarters and platinum embellishments, including wall features created from meteoric stones and actual T-Rex Dinosaur bones. One of <a href=#>the world's rarest diamonds</a>, an 18.5-carat one, is featured in a luxury liquor bottle on board the ship. Take a look at the diamond-encrusted bespoke iPhone, which features two diamonds that can be swapped out for the home button. It's possible to forget that you're at sea if you don't notice the 24-carat gold-plated panoramic wall aquarium on board the boat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There has been no mention of the superyacht's performance or other qualities as you may have realized this by now. Despite the thorough quality of the features discussed, it felt like they were just a random assortment of stuff they gave to justify such an excessive price tag. The fact that none of it was real was an even more ridiculous claim than the rumored price of $4.8 billion for a yacht.</p><h2 id=rumors-and-speculations-on-the-history-supreme>Rumors And Speculations On The History Supreme</h2><p>When news of History Supreme spread, many representatives for Hughes acknowledged to various media sites, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including in emails sent to Business Insider</a>, that the reports contained accurate information. After that, there was complete and utter stillness coming from their end. The name History Supreme made the <a href=#>yacht sound like an insane vessel</a> that not even a wealthy villain would buy, and there's a good reason for it. It was never a thing, and nor was it ever created, and no, it is not out there. History Supreme is likely the biggest boating fraud in the industry, despite what Google and a few reputable yachting websites want you to think.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Baia Yachts, based in Italy, issued a statement saying that the photos allegedly showing History Supreme posted on Hughes' website were stolen from its website and appropriated without permission at some point after the initial story was published. Hughes has not removed the post for whatever reason, and if it were up to him, he would still have you believe that he developed and sold the world's most costly boat, which the manufacturers constructed with more than 220,000 pounds of 24-carat gold.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Here's What Makes Pierchic Pizza The Most Expensive Pizza In The World" href=#>Here's What Makes Pierchic Pizza The Most Expensive Pizza In The World</a></span></p><p>Sources:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Super Yacht Times</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Boat International</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lifestyle Asia</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGZsXW16o7XLpaCopl2rsrS%2FxKVkoZ2imsBuw8eaq2alkaCytHnHoqqtp6KuerTBz6ucpp1dqbWmecyoqq1lla29prrSoq2eZamWsKnAjKKlZqyYmnq4u9Glm2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-4-8-billion-vessel-heres-what-makes-history-supreme-the-most-expensive-yacht-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-4-8-billion-vessel-heres-what-makes-history-supreme-the-most-expensive-yacht-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-4-8-billion-vessel-heres-what-makes-history-supreme-the-most-expensive-yacht-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-4-8-billion-vessel-heres-what-makes-history-supreme-the-most-expensive-yacht-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-4-8-billion-vessel-heres-what-makes-history-supreme-the-most-expensive-yacht-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-4-8-billion-vessel-heres-what-makes-history-supreme-the-most-expensive-yacht-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nina-dobrev-and-paul-wesley-are-they-close.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nina-dobrev-and-paul-wesley-are-they-close.html>How Close Are They In Real Life?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./has-sufjan-stevens-health-issues-guillain-barre-syndrome-impacted-his-net-worth.html>Has Sufjan Stevens' Tragic Health Issues Impacted His Mysterious Net Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./has-sufjan-stevens-health-issues-guillain-barre-syndrome-impacted-his-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
