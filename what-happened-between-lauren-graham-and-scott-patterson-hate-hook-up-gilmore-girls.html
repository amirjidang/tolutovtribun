While <a href=#>Gilmore Girls turned 20 in 2020</a>, there is still so much to love and discover about the show. And we still feel envious of the residents of Stars Hollow who can participate in such fun celebrations in such a quaint place. We can't say enough good things about this TV town.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gilmore Girls would never be the massive success it is without the talents of Lauren Graham. <a href=#>The actress has a high net worth</a> from several movie roles and from portraying Sarah Braverman on Parenthood, and she also made good money playing Lorelai Gilmore for 7 seasons (along with, of course, the Netflix revival A Year In The Life). It's awesome laughing at Lorelai's jokes, coffee addiction, and back-and-forth conversation with Luke Danes. But did Lauren actually get along with the actor who played her love interest? Let's take a look at what really happened between Gilmore Girls actors Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson.</p><h2 id=lauren-graham-and-scott-patterson-39-s-39-gilmore-girls-39-relationship>Lauren Graham And Scott Patterson's 'Gilmore Girls' Relationship</h2><p>Fans wonder about <a href=#>Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel's friendship</a> as it would be so sad to hear that they don't hang out IRL. Unfortunately, they have never been incredibly close, although they sound kind and respectful when talking about each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When we watch a beloved couple on TV, it's hard not to ship them and think that if they could just take their romance offscreen, they would be perfect. While Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson didn't date in real life, fans have always hoped that the actors are at least good friends.</p><p>When Michael Ausellio interviewed Lauren Graham for TV Guide, she shared more about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her relationship with co-star Scott Patterson</a>. It sounds like they liked each other and got along well but they weren't incredibly close.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Lauren was asked how she got along with Scott, she said, "Totally great. It's a working relationship, like most of them are. But he was so great in that part. I really loved my scenes with him and the chemistry we had. Our banter was among the most fun stuff to do."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here’s How Milo Ventimiglia Feels About His ‘Gilmore Girls’ Character Jess Mariano</a></span></p><p>Even if Scott Patterson and Lauren Graham just had a professional relationship and weren't friends, at least fans still have the sweet memories of Luke and Lorelai.</p><p>The characters have one of the best origin stories of any TV couple as they become friendly when Lorelai discovers that Luke makes amazing coffee. And, of course, since Lorelai is addicted to caffeine, she has to go into the diner every single morning for her fix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About 'Gilmore Girls' Dance Marathon Episode</a></span></p><h2 id=what-will-happen-between-scott-and-lauren-on-season-2-of-39-a-year-in-the-life-39>What Will Happen Between Scott And Lauren On Season 2 Of 'A Year In The Life'?</h2><p>While season 2 of A Year In The Life might not be in the works, Scott Patterson has shared a lot of thoughts on his podcast I Am All In. The fact that the actor has been watching the show for the very first time and talking about it every week (and also interviewing his co-stars) has allowed him to think about what stories he'd like to see if the show ever comes back again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scott Patterson told Us Weekly that in his mind, “[Rory] has the baby. IIf it’s Logan (Matt Czuchry) or whatever, then, you know, he flips out and goes away. History repeats itself a la Christopher (David Sutcliffe) and Lorelai." He continued that he thinks Luke and Lorelai would look after the child for Rory for a while: "And then she goes off to pursue a huge opportunity in Europe for her writing and dumps the baby in our lap. And we get to raise the kid a little bit while she’s off pursuing that and she comes back.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jane Levy On How 'Gilmore Girls' Star Lauren Graham Inspired Her</a></span></p><p>In an interview with Collider, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren Graham talked about the future of Gilmore Girls</a>, and she definitely seems open to a season 2 if it ever happens. The actress said, "If that came up again, I love that character so much and I love Amy. I will work with her, any time. It would just be a matter of responsibility to the fans and what we could give them that’s deserving of their devotion, or should it just live in reruns. So, I don’t know."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans would love to see Lauren Graham play Lorelai Gilmore in more episodes. But even if that doesn't happen, at least we have all 7 seasons and a revival to watch whenever we want, and we can continue to swoon over Luke and Lorelai's relationship.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>This ‘Gilmore Girls’ Fan Theory Came True</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmpJGqv6a6jKCpmqCRonqiusNmqpynpKl6sa3TrZyrq5%2Bjeqmt055koaefoHq2vIygoKWln6eybrPIq6OsZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-between-lauren-graham-and-scott-patterson-hate-hook-up-gilmore-girls.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-between-lauren-graham-and-scott-patterson-hate-hook-up-gilmore-girls.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-lauren-graham-and-scott-patterson-hate-hook-up-gilmore-girls.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-between-lauren-graham-and-scott-patterson-hate-hook-up-gilmore-girls.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-lauren-graham-and-scott-patterson-hate-hook-up-gilmore-girls.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-lauren-graham-and-scott-patterson-hate-hook-up-gilmore-girls.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-scenes-conversations-with-friends.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-scenes-conversations-with-friends.html>What Taylor Swift Really Thinks Of Joe Alwyn's Romance Scenes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-mason-temples-age-how-old-is-the-actor.html>What Is Mason Temples Age?
