Wanting to stay friends, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the cast agreed on certain rules, including a "no hook-up rule,"</a> (reportedly suggested by director Jim Burrows) to avoid unnecessary drama unfolding behind the scenes.</p><p><a href=#>Matthew Perry revealed one strict rule the cast of Friends never dared to break</a>.</p><p>He explained to Access, "There was a rule that we had - it was really important to the six of us that we kept a friendship; that we were friends. And we are really good friends to this day. And we kept that going, and I think that was very important."</p><p>David Schwimmer, who played Ross Geller on the show, agreed with the decision to avoid romance and anything else that could get in the way of the group becoming close, concluding, "We didn't want to jeopardize any of the relationships and friendships we were forming and had established. It was kind of an unspoken [rule]." Matt LeBlanc characterized the relationship between the cast as "more like siblings".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/how-matt-leblanc-and-lisa-kudrow-really-felt-about-their-perfect-kiss-on-friends-copy.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Matt LeBlanc's Net Worth Reached $85 Million Since 'Friends' Ended</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Matt LeBlanc has had quite a journey in Hollywood since Friends wrapped, and it's resulted in an impressive net worth.</span><p>Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe Buffay), Jennifer Aniston (Rachel Green) and Courteney Cox (Monica Geller), claim to have no memory of that rule. Cox commented, "I think it's a smart idea, but I don't remember actually talking about it."

The co-stars bonded early, wanted to avoid drama and agreed to stick together, which meant cast in-fighting and "bitterness" over paychecks was avoided.</p><p>On The Howard Stern Show, Jennifer Aniston discussed why the main cast made sure they were all paid equally when salaries were renegotiated. "We're all doing the same amount of work. I wouldn't have felt comfortable knowing I was making more," Aniston explained, per US Magazine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/friends-wrote-an-episode-based-on-a-real-experience-that-took-place-with-the-cast-backstage.jpg><p>Courteney Cox agreed, "We all felt that way. I thought it was the most important thing - as we all did - that we were equal in every single way. That was the first time people had all stuck together in a cast. I think it was scary, probably, for productions after that." Lisa Kudrow added that doing things like this, "just got rid of bitterness.

Although certain cast members claim they don't recall a "no hookup rule," it seems the real focus of the pact was to forge and maintain a good friendship between the co-stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The late Matthew Perry remarked that unnecessary drama off-camera might have started problems between the co-stars, which could have meant trouble for the series.</p><p>"If we were hooking up, or there was any strangeness going on, that could have messed with things. So we kept a friendship, and we did become really good friends," per The Daily Mail.</p><p>Another tradition for the cast was started by David Schwimmer. Before the show would start, the cast gathered in a "secret huddle" together to provide each other with support.</p><p>"I think it's something a lot of theater companies do, a lot of casts before a play," Schwimmer explained, "And I just thought we were an ensemble; to just have one moment of all of us focusing right before we go out there, wishing each other a good, safe, fast show," per The Daily Mail.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We're all friends," Matt LeBlanc remarked, and Matthew Perry agreed, "We enjoy each other's time."
