Starting out with roles in smaller indie movies such as Hackers and Foxfire, she got her big break in the acclaimed 1999 drama,&nbsp;Girl, Interrupted, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. This led to her being cast as Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider movie franchise, which propelled her to super-stardom. Nowadays, she is more focused on directing and her extensive humanitarian work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2005, Angelina fell in love with her Mr. and Mrs. Smith co-star, Brad Pitt, and they became Hollywood’s new super couple. Dubbed "Brangelina" by the press, the couple went on to have three biological children, a daughter, Shiloh, and twins, Vivienne and Knox, and Brad adopted Jolie’s three adopted children, Maddox, Pax, and Zahara. While the pair finally married in 2014, sadly, they split shortly after in 2016. While they tried not to spoil their children with extravagant gifts, there are several instances where they decided to spend a lot of money on them. Keep on reading to find out more!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=go-kart-private-party-for-the-kids>Go Kart Private Party For The Kids</h2><p>Go Kart World in Carson, California is a go-karting park&nbsp;that is really popular with celebrities, with celebrities such as David and Victoria Beckham, Kate Hudson, Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore, and Owen Wilson having visited it in the past. So it’s only natural that in 2010 when their son Maddox expressed interest in celebrating his 9th birthday by going go-karting with his friends, Angie and Brad chose this particular go-karting park. They rented it out for the whole day, meaning that Maddox, his siblings, and his friends got to enjoy a private party. It goes without saying that the whole day came to a substantial amount of money. But along with being paid well, the staff of Go Kart World also got a pleasant experience as they said that the Jolie-Pitts were really nice, polite, and respectful hosts.</p><h2 id=hot-air-balloon-and-riverside-ride>Hot Air Balloon And Riverside Ride</h2><p>In 2007, Angelina adopted a 3-year-old boy from a Vietnamese orphanage. Although she had been dating Pitt for two years at the time and they already had one biological child together, she applied for the adoption as a single parent because Vietnamese laws don’t allow unmarried couples to adopt children. However, when she brought the little boy, now called Pax, to America, she applied to have his surname changed to Jolie-Pitt, and Brad adopted him not long after. In 2011, the whole family flew out to Paris, France for the weekend to celebrate Pax’s 7th birthday. The lavish birthday celebration started out with a 20-minute hot air balloon ride and ended with a 90-minute cruise up the river aboard the Josephine, a luxurious riverboat. Blue and yellow balloons could be seen on the boat, along with plenty of sweets and cakes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=new-wardrobe-and-princess-party>New Wardrobe and Princess Party</h2><p>In 2005, Angelina adopted her first daughter, Zahara, who was&nbsp;six months old at the time, from an orphanage in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. Zahara was initially believed to be an AIDS orphan, but this turned out to be incorrect. After returning to the states, Zahara’s surname was changed to Jolie-Pitt and she was adopted by Brad not long after that. Her big brother, Maddox, welcomed her with open arms and doted on her from day one. In 2015, Zahara’s parents decided to celebrate her 10th birthday in a truly special and expensive way. Not only was she treated to a brand new and super-expensive wardrobe, Angie and Brad also threw her a princess-themed party, which cost a whopping $20,000!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=for-some-reason-they-need-six-nannies>For Some Reason They Need Six Nannies</h2><p>Even though Angelina and Brad have always made an effort to be as involved as possible in their children’s lives, their jobs don’t always allow them to be as hands-on as they would like, and ever since splitting up in 2016, Angie’s had to balance being a single mom to six kids with her directorial and humanitarian work. This is the main reason why she relies on a team of nannies to help her out. To be precise, each of her children has their own full-time nanny, meaning that she employs a total of six full-time nannies! Her brother, James, supervised the team of nannies for a while after her split from Brad, but he was quietly let go in 2017. It is rumored that Angie spends millions of dollars a year to pay all these nannies. That’s a lot of money!</p><h2 id=team-of-tutors-is-a-must-for-the-big-brood>Team Of Tutors Is A Must For The Big Brood</h2><p>Angelina attended Beverly Hills High School as a teen but didn’t enjoy her time there, feeling isolated from her peers and hating the quality of education, so she took extra classes to graduate early at the age of 16 and focus full-time on her acting. She’s said numerous times that she felt that she wasn’t taught enough in school and, therefore, didn’t want her children to receive the same education (or lack thereof, in her opinion). This is why she chose to homeschool them. Another factor that influenced this decision is that her adopted children come from various countries, and she doesn’t want them to become detached from their culture. This is why she has hired a vast team of quality tutors from around the world to teach all of her children about each other’s cultures. It’s great that she can afford to give them the best education money can buy!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=boutique-shopping-in-paris>Boutique Shopping in Paris</h2><p>In 2011, Angie and Brad flew their children to Paris for the weekend to celebrate Pax’s 7th birthday, but don’t think that the other children were neglected during their weekend there! Angie has always made sure that she treats all of her children equally, and although she rarely buys them super-expensive presents because she doesn’t want them to be as spoiled as other celebrity children, if she decides to treat one child to an expensive present, the other children will receive equally expensive gifts. This is the main reason why she took her daughters Zahara and Shiloh with her to the Bonpoint boutique, a swanky and celeb-friendly boutique selling children’s clothes and toys. The girls picked out clothes and toys for themselves and their siblings. The staff gushed over Angie’s friendliness and parenting skills, describing the girls as well-behaved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=holiday-home-in-france>Holiday Home In France</h2><p>France has always held a special place in Angelina’s heart. This is mainly due to her mother and grandmother being French, so Angelina has many fond childhood memories of visiting France. She also had a much better relationship with her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who sadly passed away from ovarian cancer in 2007, than she has with her father, Jon Voight, who is also an actor. Brad also got along with Marcheline, so France became a really special place for him as well. This is why the couple decided to purchase a chateau on the French Riviera in 2008. Angelina was pregnant with her twins, Vivienne and Knox, at the time, and had decided to give birth to them in France. The chateau, worth $35 million, has 35 rooms, a swimming pool, lake, forest, vineyard, and chapel. We’re sure all their kids enjoy their French holiday home!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=private-french-school>Private French School</h2><p>Angelina has always been proud of her French roots on her mother’s side. This is why she regularly takes her children to France and encourages them to learn French. In fact, she even enrolled her eldest son, Maddox, in the Lycée Français de New York! The name literally translates into the French High School of New York and it is a bilingual and private independent school, with lessons taught in both French and English. The school follows the rigorous curriculum of the French Educational system, so students enrolled in this school have to study way harder than students enrolled in private schools that follow the American curriculum. Tuition fees are sky-high, with parents having to fork out $36,500 a year. Well, at least their children are a getting quality education for that price!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=disneyland-for-all>Disneyland For All</h2><p>Angelina and Brad shocked the world in 2016 when they announced their divorce. Their divorce proceedings started out as very public and were accompanied by a very bitter custody battle over their six children. Luckily, they realized that the children were suffering way too much, and so they decided to seal all public records of their divorce case. This is why it is unknown whether they’ve actually divorced, but what they have revealed to the public is that they’re making an effort to be civil towards each other for the sake of their kids. Since 2016 and 2017 were really stressful years for the Jolie-Pitt kids, Angie treated her daughter, Shiloh, to an outing to Disneyland for her 11th birthday. Shiloh was joined by her siblings, Vivienne and Knox, and some of their friends.That’s really sweet and generous of her!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=trip-to-london-and-cambodia>Trip To London And Cambodia</h2><p>In March 2017, Angelina took all six of her children with her on a week-long trip. They started off by visiting London, which is one of the more expensive capitals in Europe, and then they flew to Cambodia. Maddox is originally from Cambodia, so any visit to Cambodia is special to him, as he’s getting in touch with his roots, but his siblings also love it there. While Angelina was directing the movie,&nbsp;First They Killed My Father, which is about the bombing of Cambodia and use of child soldiers during the Vietnam War, her children spent a lot of time there and became really good friends with the local children, who appeared in the movie. It’s really lucky that they can afford to fly back and forth to Cambodia!</p><h2 id=will-her-kid-really-play-the-ukulele>Will Her Kid Really Play The Ukulele?</h2><p>With both parents being A-list actors, you might expect their biological children to follow in their footsteps. While daughter Vivienne did have a small role in the 2014 movie,&nbsp;Maleficent, which Angelina starred in, Shiloh hasn’t really shown any interest in acting, but she has shown interest in becoming a musician! In 2016, Shiloh told her mom that she wanted a music instrument of her own, so Angie took her to the famed Guitar Center in Hollywood, where the then-10-year-old picked out a gorgeous and expensive ukulele. The little girl was so excited about and pleased with her new gift that she was seen excitedly strumming the ukulele with the price tag still on it as they were leaving the guitar shop. Aw, that really is so adorable, don’t you agree?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vintage-camera-for-her-producer-son>Vintage Camera For Her Producer Son</h2><p>Angelina’s daughter, Shiloh, has attracted a lot of attention from the media due to her gender non-conforming appearance. She prefers to keep her hair short and wear boys’ clothes. For a while, she even preferred male pronouns and wanted to be called John. Unlike many gender non-conforming kids who are sadly disowned by their parents, Shiloh’s parents are very understanding and supportive and encourage her to express herself however she pleases. They encourage anything their children show interest in, so when 10-year-old Shiloh expressed an interest in photography in 2016, Angie was more than happy to take her shopping for vintage cameras. They looked at various models, with Angie asking plenty of questions and Shiloh listening to every word, and they settled on a vintage camera with a black-and-white feature. We can’t wait to see Shiloh’s amazing photos one day!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ballet-lessons>Ballet Lessons</h2><p>Okay, you’re probably thinking that there are more expensive things than ballet lessons and that plenty of non-famous children enroll their kids in ballet classes, which is true, but Angie and Brad haven’t enrolled daughters, Zahara and Shiloh, in any old ballet studio lessons. Instead, the girls go for ballet lessons to the prestigious Princess Ballet and Tap at Studio City whenever they’re in Los Angeles. Since it’s one of the most prestigious ballet studios in the city, prices are astronomical and, therefore, only celebrity children and rich children go there. Angie and Brad have enrolled all of their children in plenty of extra-curricular activities, with the boys regularly going to soccer practice, as they want their children to be active and to socialize normally with other children. That’s good parenting, indeed!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=yep-her-kids-get-golden-pacifiers>Yep, Her Kids Get Golden Pacifiers</h2><p>Every major milestone in Brad and Angelina’s relationship has made front-page news, so naturally, the media went crazy over the news of Brangelina’s first biological child. On May 27, 2006, daughter Shiloh Jolie-Pitt was born. Since the paparazzi were desperate to get a picture of the newborn, Angie and Brad beat them to it by selling photos of Shiloh to Getty Images, which were then purchased by People and Hello! magazines. The couple donated their $4.1 million profit to charity. However, as their first-born, they obviously felt that Shiloh deserved a major treat and had a pacifier made for her out of 14-karat white gold. Encrusted with 270 diamonds, the pacifier is worth a whopping $17,000. This pacifier can be seen on the aforementioned first official photos of the newborn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=suzuki-motorbike>Suzuki Motorbike</h2><p>In 2002, Angelina adopted a 7-month-old baby boy from a Cambodian orphanage and named him Maddox. Although she was still married to Billy Bob when she first applied to adopt Maddox in 2001, the couple split during the adoption proceedings and she raised her son as a single mother. Brad Pitt legally adopted Maddox in 2006 and his name was changed to Maddox Jolie-Pitt. On August 5, 2012, Maddox turned 11, and his parents decided to treat him to an awesome but expensive birthday present— a Suzuki motorbike! To be precise, it’s a Suzuki DRZ-125 motorbike, designed specifically for pre-teens and it reaches a maximum speed of 50 miles per hour. The gift was Brad’s idea, as he wanted his son to ride it on their private land in Germany.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWLCo7HRZpyxqJWjwKrCxGaroaGenMBurc2gnKWhnpZ6q7vLopxmmp%2BqtKnAjJ%2Bmq2WYmr9ut8idqmg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-uber-expensive-things-angelina-jolie-bought-for-her-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f15-uber-expensive-things-angelina-jolie-bought-for-her-kids.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f15-uber-expensive-things-angelina-jolie-bought-for-her-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f15-uber-expensive-things-angelina-jolie-bought-for-her-kids.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-uber-expensive-things-angelina-jolie-bought-for-her-kids.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-uber-expensive-things-angelina-jolie-bought-for-her-kids.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aunjanue-elizabeth-flanagan-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-60717-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aunjanue-elizabeth-flanagan-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-60717-html.html>Aunjanue Elizabeth Flanagan Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-magic-school-bus.html>15 Things You Didn't Know About The Magic School Bus</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-magic-school-bus.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
