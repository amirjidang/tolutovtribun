In fact, just two percent of the world’s population is naturally blonde. Women have been trying to go blonde even before Christ. In accident Rome, women actually tried to die their hair blonde with pigeon droppings. In renaissance Venice, they used horse urine. No word on how effective those two methods worked.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being blonde has been a signature look for many actresses in Hollywood. But even if it looks natural, it’s not easy to have the color as a signature look. Take <a title="Marilyn Monroe Net Worth" href=#>Marilyn Monroe</a>, for example. According to her long-time hairdresser, Gladys Rasmussen, Marilyn’s signature look took a lot of work, “There are several problems with doing Marilyn's hair; its very fine and therefore hard to manage. It gets oily if it isn't shampooed every day and her hair is naturally so curly that to build a coiffure for her I have to first give her a straight permanent. The way we got her shade of platinum is with my own secret blend of Sparkling Silver bleach plus 20 volume peroxide and a secret formula of silver platinum rinse to take the yellow out.” It’s much easier for the ionic blondes of Hollywood to maintain their hair today. Everyone from <a title="Gwyneth Paltrow Net Worth" href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> to <a title="Amy Poehler Net Worth" href=#>Amy Poehler</a> has a team making their signature shades look fabulous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately though, many actresses try to go blonde and it just doesn't work for them. Or perhaps they look beautiful, but not as beautiful as they do brunette. Here are ten celebs that went blonde, but just shouldn't have.</p><h2 id=10-kim-kardashian><strong>10. Kim Kardashian</strong></h2><p>It practically broke the Internet when <a title="Kim Kardashian Net Worth" href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> went blonde a few weeks ago. However, there were conflicting reports about whether it was Kim’s real hair or a wig. First, one her colorists, Lori Goddard told US Weekly&nbsp;that Kim’s “blonde-on-blonde” included a jaw dropping <a href=#>$500</a> worth of highlights. So it had it be real, right? The reality star&nbsp;told US Weekly “I was like, 'Why not have a fun new look?’” No one really should have been surprised Kim went blonde because back in 2011, she told In Style Hair, “I wish I could have platinum blond hair like <a title="Gwen Stefani Net Worth" href=#>Gwen Stefani</a>, but it wouldn't work on me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On March 12th, various sources reported that Kim’s blonde hair was actually a wig. Hopefully it is because even Kim knows that blonde hair just doesn't work on her.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-zooey-deschanel><strong>9. Zooey Deschanel</strong></h2><p>Most people don’t know that the adorkable <a title="Zooey Deschanel Net Worth" href=#>Zooey Deschanel</a> wasn't always a brunette. Way back in 2003, she co-starred in the <a title="Will Ferrell Net Worth" href=#>Will Ferrell</a> Christmas flick, Elf as his love interest, Jovie. But being blonde was so not her thing and the actress has even said “I had to dye my hair blonde for a screen test years ago, and it really wasn't me. I’m a brunette at heart. When I had blonde hair I would wake up and be like, shocked. Your hair is part of your identity, and I've always felt like a brunette with bangs.”</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-cameron-diaz><strong>8. Cameron Diaz</strong></h2><p>A lot of people say <a title="Cameron Diaz Net Worth" href=#>Cameron Diaz</a> looks great as a blonde, but that’s only because they've never seen the babe as a bodacious brunette. Diaz has made her hair brown several times throughout the years. The only time it didn't look absolutely stunning was for the movie Being John Malkovitch, when her character was supposed to look bad. Famed hair colorist Tracey Cunningham also thinks this is true and told Instyle, “Cameron's a natural blonde but can pull off brunette hair too." Recently, the actress went back to brunette shortly after she married rock star <a title="Benji Madden Net Worth" href=#>Benji Madden</a>. She also had her nose pierced.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-anne-hathaway><strong>7. Anne Hathaway</strong></h2><p>In 2013, brunette <a title="Anne Hathaway Net Worth" href=#>Anne Hathaway</a> made her hair blonde. The actress debuted her bleached&nbsp;pixie cut for the first time at the <a href=#>Met Gala</a>. Hathaway’s transformation was courtesy of famed colorist Marie Robinson. So, why the sudden change of hair color? Hathaway did it for a movie called Song One. She told MailOnline: “I 've wanted to do it forever! I love it!” Alas, moviegoers didn't like the movie as much as Hathaway liked her hair and she eventually&nbsp;realized she looks best with her signature medium length brunette hair.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-winona-ryder><strong>6. Winona Ryder</strong></h2><p>It turns out <a title="Winona Ryder Net Worth" href=#>Winona Ryder</a>, who is best known as a dark-haired beauty, is a natural blonde. In fact, way back when Ryder was 15 or 16, a casting director told her she <a href=#>wasn’t pretty</a> enough to be an actress. She told Interview magazine 'I was in the middle of auditioning, and I was mid-sentence when the casting director said, "Listen, kid. You should not be an actress. You are not pretty enough. You should go back to wherever you came from and you should go to school. You don't have it.” Ryder went brunette for the 1986 movie Lucas and never really went back to her natural roots for too long, with the exception of her iconic role in Tim Burton's&nbsp;Edward Scissorhands.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-victoria-beckham><strong>5.Victoria Beckham</strong></h2><p>Post Spice Girls', <a title="Victoria Beckham Net Worth" href=#>Victoria Beckham</a> has been known for her signature short brunette hairstyle, but she has also had several stints as a blonde. The first time was in January 2001, when she tried to promote herself as a solo artist. But neither her blonde extensions nor her solo career as a pop star were meant to be. In 2007, Beckham&nbsp;tried the look again, but this time sans extensions. She kept the look for just two months. Ever since, despite a few blonde highlights here and there, Beckham has remained a brunette, for the most part. Hopefully, she’ll stay that way.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-natalie-portman><strong>4. Natalie Portman&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a title="Natalie Portman Net Worth" href=#>Natalie Portman</a> is known for being a natural brunette beauty, but in 2012, Portman went blonde for a currently untitled <a href=#>movie</a> written and directed by <a title="Terrence Malick Net Worth" href=#>Terrence Malick</a>, which is scheduled to be released later this year. While Portman still looks stunning as a blonde, it’s just not how the public is used to seeing her. Celebrity colorist Tracey Cunningham was responsible for this look. She told Huffington Post,&nbsp;“Natalie makes a beautiful blonde. She needed to make the change for an upcoming movie role, and using Redken's Blonde Dimensions we achieved a gorgeous, multi-dimensional golden blonde.” After filming, Natalie went back to her multi-dimensional and fabulous brown hair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-lindsay-lohan><strong>3. Lindsay Lohan</strong></h2><p>Early in her career, <a title="Lindsay Lohan Net Worth" href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> was known for her beautiful signature red locks and freckles. When little Lindsay did Freaky Friday and later Mean Girls, she embodied what it meant to be an adorable red head. But, as her life and career went more and more off track, her hair became blonder and blonder. Lindsay has had every shade of blonde under the sun, from strawberry to platinum, but the truth is it just doesn't work for her, especially with her something overly tanned orange tinted skin. We just wish Lindsay would go back to her roots and by that, we mean her&nbsp;unbleached ones.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-kelly-osbourne><strong>2. Kelly Osbourne</strong></h2><p>Former Fashion Police co-host <a title="Kelly Osbourne Net Worth" href=#>Kelly Osbourne</a> has had her hair dyed about every color of the rainbow. Her hair has been grey, black, silver, different shades of pink from light all the way to magenta and various shades of purple from eggplant to lavender. This natural brunette has also gone blonde many times and while she looks pretty, Kelly doesn’t look like herself and loses that signature Osbourne edge. Kelly looks most like herself with lavender hair. Even her former E! Channel bosses agree and she was contractually obligated to keep her hair purple until she quit the show in March 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-rihanna><strong>1. Rihanna</strong></h2><p><a title="Rihanna Net Worth" href=#>Rihanna</a> is known for her short, wild and sometimes shaved hair. It’s part of her signature bad girl look. But the pop singer certainly knows how to mix it up and has gone blonde several times. In May 2013, Rihanna posted a pic to her Instagram account sporting long Beyoncé-esque tresses. The next day the singer Tweeted, “I woke up in a new….weave!” However, a lot of times Ri Ri has gone blonde, it hasn’t been a weave, just a wig. Rihanna’s blondness has inspired others to go blonde, including Rita Ora who was called the “blonde Rihanna” after her performance at the 2015 Oscars.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>eonline.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>beautyhigh.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>thefrisky.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>dailymail.co.uk</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2Ysq2xwaxksKCfYsSmutNmmaWnnpmybq7UrWSsoJ%2BquaW602afmq6VZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebs-who-went-blonde-but-shouldnt-have.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-celebs-who-went-blonde-but-shouldnt-have.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-celebs-who-went-blonde-but-shouldnt-have.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-celebs-who-went-blonde-but-shouldnt-have.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebs-who-went-blonde-but-shouldnt-have.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebs-who-went-blonde-but-shouldnt-have.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./10-friends-stars-who-regret-their-time-on-the-show-10-who-were-sweethearts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./10-friends-stars-who-regret-their-time-on-the-show-10-who-were-sweethearts.html>10 Friends Stars Who Regret Their Time On The Show (10 Who Were Sweethearts)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dirty-dancing.html>RZA</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dirty-dancing.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
