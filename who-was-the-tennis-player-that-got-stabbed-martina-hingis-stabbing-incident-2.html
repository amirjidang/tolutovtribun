Her tennis career skyrocketed until she got stabbed by the attacker on the court in 1993.</p><p>The 48-year-old Monica Seles is a professional retired tennis player who represented Yugoslavia and the United States. One of the world’s highest WTA ranking in 1991, Monia won nine Grand Slam singles titles when she was a teenager, eight of them while representing Yugoslavia and the final one while representing the United States.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-deserving-tennis-star-monica-seles-got-stabbed-in-1993-full-story-here></span>The Deserving Tennis Star Monica Seles Got Stabbed In 1993- Full Story Here<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The day was April 30, 1993. When pro Tennis player Monica Seles was attacked by a man at the 1993 Hamburg Open. Although Monica has moved on from the stabbing incident, her career changed after the terrible incident.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Monica had the potential to become the top-ranked tennis player, but somehow she lost confidence and her best form that day.</p><p>In 1994, after becoming a US citizen, Monica returned to the tournaments in 1995, while her comeback was extraordinary. Her victory at the 1996 Australian Open was commendable. She played her last match at the 2003 French Open.</p><p>Following her retirement in February 2008, Monica’s name was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2009.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=following-a-tragic-attack-on-court-monica-seles-lost-first-game-with-martina-hingis-in-1999></span>Following A Tragic Attack On Court Monica Seles Lost First Game With Martina Hingis In 1999<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite Monica Seles’s first loss in tennis to Martina Hingis in 1999, she didn’t give up. She continued to play tennis after a brief hiatus from the stabbing incident. Her career was highly affected by the incident.</p><p>Further, Monica became the youngest French Open Champion ever in 1990 at age 16. Yet, her career took a U-turn when a man stabbed her in the shoulder with a sharp knife. Monica, then 19, was sitting on a courtside seat after playing her first match against Magdalena Maleeva at the Hamburg Open. She was 19, reported by&nbsp;History.</p><p>Guess what? Monica didn’t play tennis for two years after the attack and eventually returned to the tour in 1995. It wasn’t a cakewalk for her to play with the same energy, yet she gave her 100% in every game.</p><p>Please have a look at her career highlights. Monica is the first female tennis player to win her first six Grand Slam singles finals in the 1990 French Open, 1991 Australian Open, 1991 French Open, 1991 US Open, 1992 Australian Open, and 1992 French Open.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-monica-seles-stabber-gunter-parche-now></span>Where Is Monica Seles Stabber Gunter Parche Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Monica Seles attacker Gunter Parche, then 38, was imprisoned for nearly six months before his trial. He was mentally ill. Due to this, Gunter wasn’t jailed, instead sentenced to two years probation and ordered to undergo psychological treatment.</p><p>In one of her interviews, Seles revealed Parche had threatened her, ‘If you come to Germany, you’re next. She decided not to go to Germany to participate in the game.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Gunter Parche’s wiki, he now resides in a nursing home in Nordhausen, Thuringia.</p><p>What is Monica Seles doing now? Monica has kept herself busy with several works. She has written two young adult novels and has also been involved in mental health advocacy. In 2009, she published a memoir, “Getting a Grip: On My Body, My Mind, My Self.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHq4rdJmq6GdXamyr7rIrGSppJGusrN506GYrWWXpMFuv9OamZudlGK6or7ToqWaZZieu6i10maqrZmSl7avs4yipZyhlJq7tXmRaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-was-the-tennis-player-that-got-stabbed-martina-hingis-stabbing-incident-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-was-the-tennis-player-that-got-stabbed-martina-hingis-stabbing-incident-2.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-was-the-tennis-player-that-got-stabbed-martina-hingis-stabbing-incident-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-was-the-tennis-player-that-got-stabbed-martina-hingis-stabbing-incident-2.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-was-the-tennis-player-that-got-stabbed-martina-hingis-stabbing-incident-2.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-was-the-tennis-player-that-got-stabbed-martina-hingis-stabbing-incident-2.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./822949-wrestlemania-33-results-brock-lesnar-vs-goldberg-wwe-universal-championship-match.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./822949-wrestlemania-33-results-brock-lesnar-vs-goldberg-wwe-universal-championship-match.html>WrestleMania 33 Results: Brock Lesnar vs Goldberg WWE Universal Championship Match</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-sally-ann-howes-husband-douglas-rae-chitty-chitty-bang-bang-actress-dies-at-91.html>Who Is Sally Ann Howes Husband Douglas Rae?
