<time>13 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>It's always tough to&nbsp;recall the scene when Derek&nbsp;Shepherd died on&nbsp;Grey's Anatomy. Patrick Dempsey recently came back to the show to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as Meredith hallucinated him on a beach</a>&nbsp;and viewers were&nbsp;very emotional about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it would have been wonderful if Derek&nbsp;and Meredith had been together forever, that wasn't the case, and she began to move on and date other people. One person she truly seemed to love was Andrew DeLuca. Fans had strong opinions about&nbsp;this romance. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The couple had an age gap</a>&nbsp;and it was definitely tough to watch her fall in love with someone other than Derek.</p><p>DeLuca died in a recent episode of&nbsp;Grey's Anatomy. How did fans react? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=a-big-surprise>A Big Surprise</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meredith was originally going to&nbsp;date Burke</a>, but then the decision was made for her to fall for Derek. And when&nbsp;she began falling for DeLuca, it was hard not to see that they had a real connection.</p><p>In the season 17 episode "Helplessly Hoping," which aired on March 11th, 2021, DeLuca passed away after getting stabbed. It was definitely a shocking moment, even though fans know that the show has killed off many characters over the years. DeLuca was attempting to help a sex trafficker get arrested but unfortunately lost his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans couldn't believe that the show killed DeLuca</a> since it had just returned from a hiatus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Andrew-DeLuca-Greys-Anatomy.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;USA Today, one fan wasn't pleased with the storyline and tweeted, "Andrew DeLuca deserved more than this ending."</p><p>Another fan tweeted, "Goodbye Andrew Deluca #GreysAnatomy I honestly still can’t believe they did that when the show had just returned."</p><p>It definitely seems like the&nbsp;general fan response was a surprise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One fan shared on&nbsp;Reddit, "Why do the best characters just get taken out? DeLuca was my favorite character. They should have not killed him like that." Another viewer shared in the same thread that it was surprising that he would have been hurt badly enough to die: "I was not expecting Deluca to die at all! His injury did not seem that bad compared to ones they see all the time especially for a main character. I was surprised they didn’t show his sisters reaction to him going back into surgery or not being in his room."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Does Judd Apatow Still Have A Problem With Katherine Heigl?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-the-actor-react>How Did The Actor React?</h2><p>Giacomo Gianniotti said he thought it was good for the show to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">raise awareness of human trafficking</a> through his character's death.</p><p>He told&nbsp;Deadline, "what if DeLuca was to save the day but to lose his life in the process, to die a hero saving all these people and all these children who potentially could’ve been trafficked, but now will not be because the traffickers were stopped?

He said, "We spent a lot of time with each other, and so, although it’s a beautiful experience and I’m happy to be leaving in this way, and the story we get to tell is so beautiful, and I think it’s going to help a lot of people, I’m obviously sad to leave all my great, dear friends."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Walsh Says She’s All For Returning To ‘Grey’s Anatomy’</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Meredith-DeLuca-Greys-Anatomy.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Showrunner Krista Vernoff shared with&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;that she hadn't wanted DeLuca to die&nbsp;while dealing with his mental health struggles.
