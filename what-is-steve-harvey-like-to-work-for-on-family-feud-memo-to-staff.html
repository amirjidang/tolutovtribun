He first became popular in the 80s as a comedian and has evolved into the megastar he is today. He is considered one of the nicest guys in showbiz. So it would be hard to imagine how he treats his guests and contestants on his show differently from how he treats his staff, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Except he has been making headlines for a note passed to his staff that doesn't portray him in the nicest light…</p><h2 id=what-is-steve-harvey-like-as-a-boss>What Is Steve Harvey Like As A Boss?</h2><p>We haven't personally worked for Steve Harvey, so it would be irresponsible to speculate what he is like as a boss all the time. However, a note has been going around, which was shared on Robert Feder's blog (via Variety), that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvey had allegedly sent to his employees</a>. As for when this message was sent? Variety reports that it was ahead of filming in Chicago for the Steve Harvey Show's fifth season.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Steve Harvey Went Off-Script And Got Emotional During Family Feud After He Spotted A Surprise Guest In The Audience</a></span></p><p>"Good morning, everyone.

Could he be trying to filter out the noise, so he can better focus before the start of a show? Some would say that his request is not such a big ask. But others would disagree entirely and say that being unable to approach someone is downright rude. The message continues, with Harvey explaining his reasons for adopting this new policy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I have been taken advantage of by my lenient policy in the past.
