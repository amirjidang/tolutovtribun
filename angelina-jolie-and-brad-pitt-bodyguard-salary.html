Not only were they at the top of the Hollywood world but at home, they were taking care of six kids, Shiloh, Vivienne, Knox, Maddox, Pax and Zahara.</p><p>Of course, the couple got lots of help behind the scenes, and that included a variety of different nannies. Krisann Morel, a former nanny for the couple opened up about the experience working for the couple, stating that <a href=#>the nannies would rotate taking care of the children.</a></p><p>"There were so many helpers that she often had one nanny put her in bed at night and another one to wake her up in the morning," Morel told the publication about Jolie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Did Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Purposely Pick A Distant College To Stay Away From Mom Angelina?</a></span></p><p>Your Tango stated that even when times were tough between Jolie and Pitt, and two never showed it in front of its staff, nor the children, always keeping things as professional as possible.</p><p>Protection was also just as important for the couple, and it seems as though they were willing to pay top dollar for it.</p><h2 id=mark-billingham-made-a-fortune-as-brad-and-angelina-s-bodyguard-but-the-hours-were-long>Mark Billingham Made A Fortune As Brad And Angelina's Bodyguard, But The Hours Were Long</h2><p>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie had some insecurities and one of them involved the well-being of their children, especially given all the traveling the couple was doing at the time.</p><p>Hiring a security guard or bodyguard was of the utmost importance and the couple was not concerned about price.</p><p>Enter Mark Billingham, who worked as a celeb bodyguard for years. <a href=#>He opened up about the unique experience</a> alongside The Sun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When I eventually left the military in 2007 and got a proper job I ended up as a bodyguard to celebrities such as Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Russell Crowe and Michael Caine. I earned really good money – three times as much as I was earning in the military. I think it was more than £10,000 a month."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Shiloh Jolie-Pitt Wanted Her Parents To Call Her John Or Peter</a></span></p><p>Billingham had a great relationship with both the couple and kids, however, the hours were a lot to handle, especially given that the bodyguard had kids of his own back at home.</p><p>He revealed to becoming a father-figure type with the kids.

Nonetheless, the celebrity bodyguard revealed that he enjoyed working in the space, developing close relationships with clients and being able to see the normal side of them made things that much better.</p><p>"It was great. Behind closed doors, celebrities are just normal people. They laugh and joke and take the mickey out of each other. They were always respectful to me. If I ever said there was a security reason why they couldn't do something, they never questioned it – they trusted me 100 per cent."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billingham further stated that this factor didn't diminish the stress level involved, he still needed to be on high alert at all time.</p><p>"With that sort of job, you're always looking at any threats to them. For example, there's always a danger of kidnap or somebody wanting to do something to become famous for 15 minutes – punch them or do something stupid. So your role is to make sure they're protected from that and enable them to have a normal life without being harassed all the time."</p><p>Quite the experience for Mark and one that gave the Jolie-Pitt family peace of mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp5%2BVobavrYyjpqWhlWKur7CMm6manF2ltrXAjJumnbGXqq6zsIysmKWZoq58</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fangelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt-bodyguard-salary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fangelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt-bodyguard-salary.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fangelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt-bodyguard-salary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fangelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt-bodyguard-salary.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fangelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt-bodyguard-salary.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fangelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt-bodyguard-salary.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./biaheza-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-170843-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./biaheza-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-170843-html.html>Biaheza Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./allstar-weekend-2011-events-check-out-59511.html>ALLSTAR WEEKEND 2011 EVENTS TO CHECK OUT</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./allstar-weekend-2011-events-check-out-59511.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
