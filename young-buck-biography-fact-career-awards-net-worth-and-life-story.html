At the same time a friend of his moved to Tallahassee, Florida, Brown began recording in a real studio. Shortly thereafter, he was given an opportunity to perform for Brian “Baby” Williams, co-founder of Ca$h Money. After several years on and off of Ca$h Money, Brown and fellow rapper Juvenile decided to leave the label for good in 2000 and go to UTP Records, where Brown stayed until 2003. One of his early appearances was on the song “Memphis,” where he was featured along with Three 6 Mafia, Project Pat, and other southern rappers. His deal with UTP later led to a meeting with New York rapper 50 Cent, who later signed him to G-Unit Records, under Interscope Records.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=music-career></span>Music career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=cash-money-records></span>Cash Money Records<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Young Buck would get his first major deal with Ca$h Money in 1995 when he was given an opportunity to perform to “Baby”, co-founder of Cash Money. Young Buck, soon after, would tour with Birdman on the road and do several shows together. Even though Young Buck was signed with the label, he never appeared on any of their albums or released his own under the label. After several years of being on and off Ca$h Money, Buck and fellow rapper Juvenile decided to leave the label in late 2001 where he would join Juvenile’s record label UTP Records and the rap group UTP Playas.</p><p>In late 2011, it was rumoured that Young Buck was close to resigning with Cash Money again, but the deal crumbled when the judge in Young Buck’s bankruptcy case decided to switch his ‘s case from a reorganization to a liquidation was frustrating the Young Buck’s attempts to sign with Cash Money Records and end a contract dispute with G-Unit Records that stifled his career since 2008. Judge George C. Paine II signed an order converting the case from Chapter 11 reorganization to Chapter 7 liquidation on Wednesday December 21, 2011 and Young Buck, whose real name is David Darnell Brown, stood to lose more than anticipated. The trustee administering his estate has said she plans to sell the trademarked “Young Buck” moniker itself along with other assets. However, on January 9, 2012, Cash Money Records CEO, Birdman, stepped forward to address the rumors and speculation suggesting Tennessee rapper Young Buck and West Coast hip-hop artist Lil B were on the verge of joining his team. While he admitted both artists have his respect, Birdman said there is no truth to the speculation, stating “Both of them is two of the little homies I have the utmost respect for,” he said. “I don’t know Lil B’s situation. I don’t know Buck’s situation. I’m friends to both of them. If the opportunity ever came, I would love to work with both of them. I know Buck is in a situation. I got love and respect for both of them, but they never came across the menu yet — I spoke with Buck a few times, he’s been a friend of the family. But it ain’t came to none of that.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=utp-records></span>UTP Records<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After leaving Cash Money in late 2000, Young Buck joined UTP Records and the rap group UTP Playas. His deal with UTP later led to a meeting with New York rapper 50 Cent who later signed Buck to G-Unit Records, under Interscope Records. Buck would release 2 albums <i>Born To Be A Thug</i> & <i>The Compilation</i> with UTP before leaving the label and rap group in 2003 to join 50 Cent’s record label G-Unit Records and the rap group G-Unit.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=g-unit-records></span>G-Unit Records<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After leaving UTP Records in 2003, Young Buck would link up with up and coming rap titan 50 Cent who was already making waves with his outfit G-Unit. Looking to broaden his empire, 50 Cent was quick to sign Young Buck to his G-Unit imprint and also welcome him as one of the newest members of the rap group G-Unit.</p><p>Young Buck would first begin his career with G-Unit Records in 2003 when the rap group G-Unit released their first album <i>Beg for Mercy</i>. As the album was recorded, Tony Yayo was sentenced to jail on charges of gun possession, and so makes only two appearances on the entire record, on the tracks “Groupie Love” and “I Smell Pussy”. His image is seen on the brick wall of the album cover because he could not be photographed due to the jail sentence. At the time of the album’s release, rapper The Game was not in G-Unit therefore he is not photographed nor does he make an appearance on the album. He does, however, make cameos in the videos for Stunt 101, Wanna Get To Know You, and Poppin’ Them Thangs. He was further mentioned in Poppin’ Them Thangs when Young Buck states “You ain’t no Crip like Snoop you ain’t no Blood like Game”. In its first week of sales, <i>Beg for Mercy</i> sold 377,000 copies, placing third behind Tupac Shakur’s eighth posthumous release, <i>Tupac: Resurrection</i>, which moved 430,000 albums, and Jay-Z’s <i>The Black Album</i>, which sold 463,263 copies. It sold 327,000 copies in its second week to peak at number 2 on the Billboard 200, and 193,000 in its third week. It has now sold 2.7 million units in the U.S. and over 6 million copies worldwide. It has been certified 2× platinum by the RIAA.</p><p>On August 24, 2004, Buck would release his G-Unit Records debut album <i>Straight Outta Cashville</i>, The album’s title alludes to the N.W.A album <i>Straight Outta Compton</i> and is a neologism for Nashville (his hometown). The singles from this album include “Let Me In”, “Shorty Wanna Ride”, and “Look at Me Now”. It features a lot of rappers outside of G-Unit such as Lil’ Flip, David Banner, D-Tay, Ludacris, Game, Stat Quo and production from Lil Jon, Kon Artis, and more. The album received very little promotion after November because of the VIBE award incident, after which Young Buck was arrested for assault. Though the case was dropped it had been four months since Young Buck himself had promoted the album. The album debuted at number three on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 with about 361,000 copies sold, in the first week, and has since been certified Platinum by the RIAA.</p><p>Following his debut album, Buck would join forces with the rest of the G-Unit roster at the time to release a collaboration album <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin’</i> in 2005, soon after Bucks second album <i>Buck The World</i> in 2007 would follow. Before the departure of Young Buck the highly publicised feud between G Unit and their former west coast counterpart Game had split the fanbase of the outfit in two with many fans taking sides with the Compton native. As the feud between G Unit and Young Buck was simmering behind the scenes 50 Cent released a phone call he had taped between him and Young Buck in which an emotional Buck was heard crying and asking 50 Cent for help and advice. Buck would take this personal and release several tracks towards 50 Cent and G-Unit. Buck is still signed and legally obligated to release a studio album via G-Unit Records.</p><p>In August 2012, Buck stated in an interview with XXL he was no longer signed to G-Unit Records and he would be a free agent when he is released from prison.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=solo-career></span>Solo career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After Buck was dismissed from the group for multiple reasons, he released numerous tracks attacking 50 Cent, G-Unit and their associates. 50 Cent and G-Unit also responded with many tracks, including one particular instance in which 50 Cent released a phone call he had recorded with Young Buck, which featured the Tennessee native weeping and apologizing for numerous things. After this happened, Young Buck responded, stating that the call was a fake, that happened one year prior to its release, and claimed that only police record phone calls.</p><p>After a lengthy battle between Young Buck and his former G-Unit comrades, the feud seemed to settle down, with Young Buck stating that he owed one more album for G-Unit Records which would be released in 2009, then titled <i>The Rehab</i>. In other interviews, he’s stated that he does not have a problem with 50 Cent or G-Unit anymore, but is currently doing his “own thing”. He also stated that although he’s still signed to G-Unit Records, he’s trying to get out of the contract, and he’s no longer signed to Interscope.</p><p>On September 13, 2010 an interview with Shade 45 radio host Angela Yee, 50 Cent stated that Young Buck is still signed to G-Unit Records. However Young Buck has later confirmed that he is currently a free agent and no longer signed to G-Unit Records.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=back-with-g-unit></span>Back With G-Unit<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On June 1, 2014, Young Buck was seen at the Summer Jam Concert with 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, and Tony Yayo. It was confirmed later that the group had reformed, adding Kidd Kidd as a new member. The group released their debut EP <i>The Beauty of Independence</i> on August 25, 2014. Young Buck is again making new music with G-Unit and released his mixtape <i>Before The Beast</i> which contains 7 songs featuring Kidd Kidd, Boosie, Tony Yayo, Lloyd Banks and additional artists. After releasing the mixtape, he released G-unit’s second EP <i>The Beast Is G-Unit,</i> which sold approximately 20,000 copies in its first week.</p><p>In May 2015, Young Buck announced the upcoming release of <i>Behind The Walls</i>, an in-depth book featuring the rapper’s behind-the-scenes stories with G-Unit.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span>Personal life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=financial-problems></span>Financial problems<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Brown filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in August 2010, shortly after an IRS raid on his home. His bankruptcy lawyer later told The City Paper that he was planning to sue Curtis Jackson (50 Cent) and other parties over the record contract dispute.</p><p>The IRS made plans to auction off Young Buck’s seized property on October 28, 2010, but his legal counsel filed suit to halt the sale, while simultaneously re-filing a revised bankruptcy petition that no longer referenced a $5 million legal claim against 50 Cent and other parties associated with G Unit.</p><p>In the lawsuit, Young Buck said the studio equipment taken in the raid was “directly tied to” his “ability to generate income in order to reorganize the estate.” He stated that the seizure of property that belonged to his children had “created great stress in the home” and “within the common law marriage of the debtor plaintiff.” He told the court he needed to get back the property belonging to the family.</p><p>Young Buck’s attorney was able to convince the court that he would be selling real estate worth $638,500 to begin paying the back taxes due. At a hearing on October 26, 2010, plans for the IRS auction were at least temporarily stopped. Young Buck announced the outcome with a Tweet.</p><p>Young Buck was under Chapter 7, Young Buck’s assets were to be sold and distributed among his creditors.</p><p>On July 25 and 26, a public auction is set to be held at the estate that Young Buck owns. Property to be sold includes Watches, a 50 Cent Plaque, Artwork, a soda machine, his studio equipment, and more.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=shooting></span>Shooting<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2000, Young Buck was shot multiple times during a home invasion at his home in Nashville, Tenn. The assailants were in search of narcotics. Buck required a blood transfusion at Vanderbilt hospital as a result of the life-threatening injuries.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=drive-by-shooting></span>Drive-by shooting<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Early Sunday morning on March 4, 2012, Young Buck was targeted in a drive-by shooting. According to Nashville police, via WSMV-TV Channel 4, at approximately 3:30 am, a white Chevrolet Tahoe crept past the rapper’s SUV and opened fire, hitting the vehicle 11 times. Buck, who was back in his hometown to work on new music, wasn’t injured. Police said all parties involved in the argument left the club at the same time.</p><p>After a couple of days of silence, Buck took to his Twitter to address the situation. “We all go through things in life,” the former G-Unit star tweeted. “The things I’m experiencing are Truly making me a Better and Stronger man. #GodisGood.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=legal-issues></span>Legal issues<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After an IRS raid on Buck’s Nashville home in 2010, authorities found a .40 caliber Glock 22 as well as ammunition. The raid followed reports that the rapper had an outstanding $300,000 tax debt, and because he’s a convicted felon, Buck is prohibited from possessing any firearms. Back in 2005, he pleaded no contest to assault with a chance to produce bodily injury after he stabbed a man while trying to defend Dr. Dre at the 2004 Vibe Awards.</p><p>On July 13, 2012, Buck was sentenced to 18 months in prison on weapon charges, a sentence that he began on August 6, 2012. Until then Buck had remained at his Nashville home on House Arrest with a monitoring bracelet strapped around his ankle. He served his 18 months in Yazoo City Low Security Federal Prison in Southern Mississippi, and was released on October 1, 2013.</p><p>On July 20, 2016, he sent a threatening text to his ex-girlfriend and showed up and kicked down the door without touching anything. Buck was arrested on July 21, 2016 for threatening to burn down the ex-girlfriend’s apartment. He was released on a $5,000 bond.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=controversy></span>Controversy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=vibe-awards-stabbing></span>VIBE Awards Stabbing<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On November 15, 2004, Jimmy James Johnson approached Dr. Dre at the VIBE Awards and reportedly asked for an autograph before Dr. Dre was about to go on stage. After Dr. Dre declined, Johnson punched him in the back of the head before running towards the nearest exit. A brawl ensued with several uniformed police officers attempting to break up the fight. Chairs were thrown, and it was alleged that Young Buck stabbed Johnson in the chest with a knife. After video evidence was uncovered from the awards ceremony, the Santa Monica Police Department issued an arrest warrant for him. In a preliminary hearing, it was ruled that there was enough evidence to proceed with a jury trial. However, in December 2005, a deal was reportedly struck that would see Young Buck avoid trial.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-game></span>The Game<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After The Game was kicked out of G-Unit allegedly for being disloyal, Young Buck as well as new West Coast G-Unit rapper Spider Loc who had signed to G-Unit Records in September 2004, called him to task for dissing the group and label. The Game then released a track entitled “300 Bars” which insulted both Spider Loc and Young Buck. Young Buck then released a track called “The Real Bitch Boy”, which featured Spider Loc and used a beat from The Game’s track, “Where I’m From”. In the song, Young Buck talks about how he did not even know The Game when he mentions The Game’s name on “Poppin’ Them Thangs”. Also, Young Buck talks about The Game being a male stripper and also how 50 Cent helped The Game to be successful with his album <i>The Documentary</i>.</p><p>The feud has continued to escalate, with there being an exchange of many tracks. In February 2007, The Game and Young Buck got into a non-physical altercation at a club, during the NBA All-Star Weekend in Las Vegas. The last time that they were seen together was when The Game was part of G-Unit.</p><p>After being dismissed from G-Unit, Young Buck appeared on a remix to The Game’s song Game’s Pain, as well as appearing in the music video to the song My Life, which featured another former rival, Lil Wayne. A mixtape by The Game and Young Buck was also confirmed, called “Worth More Than 50 Cents”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=albums></span>Albums<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=straight-outta-cashville></span><i>Straight Outta Cashville</i><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After being with G-Unit for a little over a year, Young Buck released his debut album, <i>Straight Outta Cashville</i>, a portmanteau reflecting the name of Young Buck’s home city, Nashville, Tennessee.</p><p><i>Straight Outta Cashville</i> has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America with over 2 million sales in the U.S. and 3.3 million Worldwide.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=buck-the-world></span><i>Buck the World</i><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Young Buck’s second album, <i>Buck the World</i> was released worldwide on March 27, 2007.</p><p><i>Buck the World</i> debuted at No. 3 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and No. 1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, with sales of 141,083 in the first week.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-rehab></span><i>The Rehab</i><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><i>The Rehab</i> was released on September 7, 2010.
