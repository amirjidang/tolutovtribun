They truly complement one another and like the theme song says, they're always there for each other. So it's really no wonder that viewers have thought up some theories about Phoebe.... and these are super intriguing.</p><p>Keep reading to find out 14 things that fans of&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;have come up with about popular character, Phoebe Buffay.</p><h2 id=phoebe-was-on-substances-the-entire-time><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Phoebe Was On Substances The&nbsp;Entire Time</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Phoebe-Buffay-Friends.png><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NME.com</a>, there is actually a theory that Phoebe was on substances the entire time.&nbsp;Marta Kauffman, the creator of Friends&nbsp;said, "That’s the saddest theory I’ve ever heard."
