Until he sheds weight before his NFL draft in 2027, the 18-year-old will have footballers running circles around him.</p><p>According to a Reddit user, the 455-pound TCU football player came to fall camp weighing nearly 500. If the reports are true, he lost almost 45 pounds since signing up.</p><h2 id=brione-ramsey-brooks-draft><span class=ez-toc-section id=brione-ramsey-brooks-draft-profile></span> Brione Ramsey Brooks Draft Profile<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brione Ramsey Brooks bench press is projected to be <strong>20 reps of 225 lbs</strong>. At the 2022 NFL Combine, 387 lbs Daniel Faalele did 24 bench press.</p><p>The bench press is the perfect way for athletes to show their upper body strength. Higher muscle mass normally equates to higher reps. Though Big Bubba is heavy, he does not have a high muscle mass to do a larger number of reps.</p><p>332 pounds Anthony Bradford did 34 reps, while Steve Avila did 28 even though they weighed the same during the 2023 NFL Combine. At 330 lbs, O’Cyrus Torrence maxed out after doing 23 bench presses.</p><p>The 6-foot-5 talent from Texas is built like a small mountain which does take a toll on the body. He will have to sacrifice speed for power.</p><p>Brione Ramsey is 18 years old and was born on January 2005 in Dallas, Texas. Big Bubba weighed 380 pounds during his senior year at South Oak Cliff. Since then, he has put on 75 pounds.</p><p>It will be interesting to see if he has the ability to use his size working for him. He will be a force to be reckoned with Isaac Newton’s Second Law of Motion at play. Force = Mass x Acceleration.&nbsp;</p><p>Defenders ingrained in winning with power will need to amend their methods against Ramsey. His physical attributes help cover up some of his athletic shortcomings, while his power can be better-made use of with accurate hand strikes.</p><p>The former high school football standout is a work in progress. He should become a starting right tackle if he maintains the playing weight as his coach sees fit.</p><table class="table table-bordered content-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td>Brione Ramsey Brooks</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nickname</strong></td><td>Big Bubba</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>6 feet 5 inches (1.95 meter)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>455 pounds (206 Kg)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>40 time</strong></td><td>6 – 6.35 seconds (estimate)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bench Press</strong></td><td>20 (estimate)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Vertical</strong></td><td>20 (estimate)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=brione-ramsey-high-school><span class=ez-toc-section id=brione-ramsey-high-school-highlights></span> Brione Ramsey High School Highlights<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>TCU freshman lineman Brione Ramsey helped his high school South Oak Cliff to win 5A Division II State Championships in 2021 and 2022.</p><p>It was the first time a Dallas Independent School district had won a state title since grabbing the title in 1958.

At the time, the athlete had received scholarship offers from Power 5 schools Georgia Tech, Arizona, and Kansas. Houston and Deion Sanders Jackson State Program had also reached out.</p><p>On the early National Signing period, 9 players from South Oak Cliff had signed to play football.

He will most likely get redshirted immediately and only see action in his junior year.</p><p>The strength and conditioning coach has been helping him lose the extra mass. Chances are he will not be able to practice much. He will only be courting major injury risks if he heads out into the field before he loses 80 to 100 pounds.&nbsp;</p><p>Though he has yet to hit the field, the young football player has already added a level of excitement to the upcoming season. Many fans are questioning his foot speed, agility, and stamina as the game speeds up from high school to college.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important task for Brione now will be to show that he can move well despite his size. Coaches should focus on deploying him after designing a play that would capitalize on his attributes.&nbsp;</p><p>If Big Bubba does hit the field in his freshman year, fans will tune in to watch the game to see whether or not the Texas talent will live up to his high school fame. Will the DL and LB run circles around him? We will just have to wait and see.</p><p>The new-found outpour of love from football enthusiasts will not stay positive if he cannot establish his dominance early on in his college football career.</p><p>Fans are hoping for him to square off with Florida defensive tackle Desmond Watson. They both stand at the same height with Watson being lighter by six pounds at 439.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqinryvsYyrmKarla56o77OqKKsZWRlerW1zJ5km52emLVuvNGeqqxlkaOxbrDRmp2tZaCnvKe1y55m</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrione-ramsey-brooks-40-time-bench-press-and-draft-profile.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbrione-ramsey-brooks-40-time-bench-press-and-draft-profile.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbrione-ramsey-brooks-40-time-bench-press-and-draft-profile.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbrione-ramsey-brooks-40-time-bench-press-and-draft-profile.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrione-ramsey-brooks-40-time-bench-press-and-draft-profile.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrione-ramsey-brooks-40-time-bench-press-and-draft-profile.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./brittny-gastineau-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./brittny-gastineau-net-worth.html>Brittny Gastineau Net Worth How Much is Brittny Gastineau Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./beyonce-wardrobe-malfunction-les-twins-1234767454.html>Beyonc Got Saved From A Wardrobe Malfunction By Her Dancers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./beyonce-wardrobe-malfunction-les-twins-1234767454.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
