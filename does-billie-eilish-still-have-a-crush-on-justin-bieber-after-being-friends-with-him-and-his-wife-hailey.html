The now 21-year-old pop icon has been rather candid about her teenage crush on Bieber, admitting that her feelings for the "Sorry" singer were so intense, they’d often reduce her to tears.</p><p>Fast-forward to the present day, where Eilish, now also an icon in the <strong><a href=#>music</a> </strong>industry, finds herself in a rather <a href=#>close-knit friendship with Justin</a> and his wife, <strong><a href=#>Hailey Bieber.</a></strong> As the lines between fandom, friendship, and romance blur, one question lingers in the air: Does Billie Eilish still harbor a crush on Justin Bieber?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=billie-eilish-once-had-an-intense-crush-on-justin-bieber>Billie Eilish Once Had An Intense Crush On Justin Bieber</h2><p>Long before her meteoritic rise to fame, Billie Eilish, like many wide-eyed teenage girls, was a huge fan of Justin Bieber, then took over the airwaves with hits like ‘As Long As You Love Me,’ ‘Beauty And A Beat’, and ‘Boyfriend.’ “It wasn’t like I was just a fan, man,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she admitted to Marie Claire in February 2019</a>. “I’ve been in love before, and it was with him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-14.png><p>But that’s not all, Billie's affection for Justin went far beyond admiration; it was a whirlwind of emotions that sometimes reduced her to tears. “I literally remember sobbing into a pillow because I thought, ‘I’m never gonna feel this way about anyone,'” she disclosed in her 2021 documentary, Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So intense were the pop icon’s feelings for Bieber that her parents contemplated taking her to therapy to help her navigate the seemingly endless flurry of emotions. "We did consider taking you to therapy, for how incredibly... you were in so much pain over Justin Bieber," Eilish’s mother, Maggie Baird, revealed during an episode of Eilish’s Apple Music show, Me & Dad Radio. "It was so intense. It caused you so much pain."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Has Billie Eilish Made From Perfume Sales?

I do not mean to be putting anybody in the position I was in.

Just months after her Marie Claire interview, Eilish attended the 2019 Coachella Music Festival, where she found herself face-to-face with none other than Bieber himself.</p><p>In the months that followed, their friendship blossomed into something so extraordinary, it brought Bieber to tears during an interview with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/does-billie-eilish-still-have-a-crush-on-justin-bieber-despite-being-friends-with-him-and-his-wife_.jpg><p>“I just wanted to be a good example. It was hard for me being that young and being in the industry and not knowing where to turn and everyone telling me they loved me and … you know … just turn their back on you in a second,” he said of his friendship with the now 21-year-old pop phenomenon.</p><p>“So If she ever needs me, I'm going to be here for her...just protecting those moments because people take for granted," he continued. "I just want to protect her, you know? I don't want her to lose it, I don't want her to go through anything I went through. I don't wish that upon anybody. So, if she ever needs me, I'm just a call away."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Did Billie Eilish Say About Lana Del Rey?
