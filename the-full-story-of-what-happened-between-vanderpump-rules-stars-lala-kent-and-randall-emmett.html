Their relationship began when Lala worked at Lisa Vanderpump's restaurant, SUR in 2015. Randall was hosting his Christmas party there and had just separated from his wife at the time. He requested Lala's number, and the two became intimate on their very first date, with Lala claiming she knew right away she would be with Randall 'forever.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The relationship between the two was full of ups and downs</a>, which made them a super hot tabloid item. They were always surrounded by drama, and the world loved watching it all unfold.

They seemed truly smitten with one another, and it seemed that their relationship was headed in the right direction - the happily ever after that Lala had always imagined would be their final destination.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Vanderpump Rules’: Ariana Madix Slams Lala Kent For Posting A Photo With Stassi And Kristen</a></span></p><h2 id=the-pandemic-pushed-their-wedding-date><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The Pandemic Pushed Their Wedding Date</span></h2><p>Just as Lala and Randall neared their big day, the global pandemic hit, and like so many other couples around the world, they were forced to <a href=#>push their wedding to a future date</a>. Of course, plans were already in place and excitement had already built, but everything had to be put on ice without a firm sense as to when the world would open up again and they could resume their lavish wedding plans.</p><h2 id=their-daughter-was-born><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Their Daughter Was Born</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their increased time together during<a href=#> quarantine clearly had Lala and Randall filing their time with fun</a>, as before long, they announced that Lala was pregnant. Fans were thrilled to hear the news, and Lala beamed with joy when their little girl was born in March of 2021, and they named their gorgeous daughter 'Ocean.' Lala immediately began documenting Ocean's life on Instagram and was quick to state that she was wanting another baby right away. Randall seemed a bit less enthused about that idea.</p><h2 id=lala-scratched-all-images-of-randall-from-instagram><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Lala Scratched All Images Of Randall From Instagram</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everything seemed to be going well with the young family until October of 2021, when Lala suddenly deleted any and all signs of Randall from her Instagram page. Her sudden desire to scratch out all references of him was a big sign to fans that there was trouble in paradise. Rumors began to fly that Lala and Randall had broken up, and they'd soon be reinforced by a series of other abrupt changes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>'I Didn't Grow Up Like This': Lala Kent Claps Back At Mom-Shaming Troll</a></span></p><h2 id=it-was-revealed-randall-emmett-cheated-in-nashville><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>It Was Revealed Randall Emmett Cheated In Nashville</span></h2><p>It didn't take long for sources to reveal that she had reason to believe that Randall Emmett had cheated on Lala Kent in Nashville. Their picture-perfect life was suddenly exhibiting real signs of being in trouble, and of course, the saddest part was that they had a very young daughter that was now thrown into the mix. Fans were glued to any signs of reconciliation but were instead met with increased signs that would suggest the breakup was serious and was likely to be a permanent one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lala-checks-into-a-hotel><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Lala Checks Into A Hotel</span></h2><p>It wasn't long before Lala Kent posted a video of herself that was far different than any others she had posted in the past. This time, the video was of her and Ocean checking in to a Beverly Hills hotel, and it was filmed as what appeared to be an intentional dig at Randall, putting him on official notice that she was dedicated to moving on, no matter what the sacrifice. She appears to have moved into the hotel for a short-term stay. Lala took the time to set this video of her hotel-move to Beyonce's song, Sorry.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>20 Things Vanderpump Rules' Lala Kent Wishes She Could Sweep Under The Rug</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lala-was-spotted-without-her-ring><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lala Was Spotted Without Her Ring</span></h2><p>Page Six reports that a Los Angeles Barnes & Noble was the setting for Lala Kent's recent book signing, and she made more than just an appearance... she also made a statement.

It is said that he has mastered the art of living as a loyal, loving significant other at times, but there are other moments that he acts quite differently. It's believed that Randall would also go on a series of benders and was very friendly with the ladies. This was proven true when he was spotted going into the Thompson hotel with two ladies in Nashville.</p><h2 id=they-bond-with-their-baby-separately><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Bond With Their Baby ....

Lala and Randall remain completely devoted to giving Ocean the very best life she can possibly have and have been sharing images of their time with her online... separately.</p><p>The two seem to have come to some amicable co-parenting terms, as it's clear that time with Ocean is a priority for them both, and they each take advantage of the one-on-one time they have with her.</p><h2 id=lala-kent-hints-that-secrets-will-be-revealed><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Lala Kent Hints That Secrets Will Be Revealed</span></h2><p>The ups and downs of this relationship are a lot to take in, and it seems that there's even more dirt that will soon be dished.
