He was born on October 23, 2003, in California, USA. Due to both of his parents being successful actors, there is a lot of speculation that he will pursue a similar career in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>He was frequently seen accompanying his mother to many film premiers and gatherings. His mother also lovingly posts photos of him on her Instagram feed. He joined Instagram in December 2016 and accumulated huge followers quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>Deacon is more than just a pretty face. He has a substantial social media following and appears to be pursuing a career in music.</p><p>Even though he is the son of actors, his fans are curious to know will he become an actor like his parents in the future?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Deacon Inclines to Music</h2><p>Known as the son of two famous actors, fans hope to see Deacon on the screen for his acting debut. But the youngster seems to be more inclined to music than in acting.</p><p>Many people don’t know that he exclusively worked on his debut album while self-quarantining during the pandemic.</p><p>Following the July release of his first single, Long Run, Deacon admitted to Interview Magazine that he is ready to branch out and start working with others.</p><p>He said, “<strong>All the music I’ve made this summer has been done digitally, for the most part. As things open up, I’m looking forward to collaborating with people I haven’t met yet. I feel like the best records are made in person.</strong>”</p><p>Reese’s son also explained his preference for being behind the scenes, though his parents love being in front of the camera.</p><p>He admitted, “<strong>When I was listening to the radio in the car with my dad, something just clicked. I realized there’s more to making music than just being a vocalist, and that a lot of times it’s the production that makes me feel something. I asked my dad about how it words, and he taught me all the stuff he knew, and then I started watching YouTube videos.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Will He Choose The Same Profession Like His Parents in the Future?</h2><p>Deacon was creating music in his mom’s basement when Norwegian music producer Kygo caught one of his tracks on social media and contacted him.</p><p>He told Billboard, “<strong>The fact that Kygo DM’d me about it and that I got to hear his compliments on the song. He’s a huge musical inspiration for me, so it just really came full-circle in a way, because he had helped me put out on the song on his label.</strong>”</p><p>Hearing Kygo congratulating him made Deacon more determined to pursue his career in music, saying, “<strong>It gave me a lot of <a href=#>motivation</a>.”</strong> In fact, his first single made it into the top 20 on iTunes after its release.</p><p>“<strong>That’s definitely something I’m interested in,” </strong>Deacon told Interview, while still having some reservations due to actors not having private lives.</p><p>He explained further, “<strong>From the time I was really young, I remember paparazzi being around. I don’t really know what it’s like not to be seen by the public.”</strong></p><p>While the rising star still has a lot of time deciding whether to pursue an acting career, Deacon is currently enjoying his music career and time with his family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Decon Long Time Girlfriend Marine Degryse</h2><p>Deacon has always been a little heartbreaker, but at 18, he’s in a serious relationship with YouTube personality Marine DeGryse. She’s a <a href=#>beauty influencer</a> known for her channel, Sweetness, with over 580,000 subscribers. He first appeared on her Instagram page in October 2019, so this relationship is going strong two years later.&nbsp;</p><p>Deacon posted a photo dump for her birthday earlier this year with a sweet caption, <strong>“Happy Birthday to my girl!! Love u more than anything.”</strong>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Deacon Parents’ Relationship and Divorce</h2><p>Ryan and Reese met during her 21st birthday party in 1997 – the two would work together in the film <strong>Cruel Intentions</strong> and begin a romantic relationship. She became pregnant, leading to the two marrying in 1999. Deacon Reese was born in 2003, growing up with older sister <a href=#>Ava Elizabeth Phillippe</a> who would later pursue a modeling career.</p><p>When he was three years old, his parents announced separating, leading to Witherspoon filing for divorce just a month later, citing irreconcilable differences. The couple battled due to the lack of a prenuptial agreement.</p><p>Deacon’s mother refused any spousal support to his father and wanted sole custody of the children. On the other hand, Ryan requested joint custody and didn’t care for spousal support. Things were eventually settled, with the couple awarded joint custody.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCwxJqaqKZdp7Kmv8Rmp6GhnKG2sbzEaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdeacon-reese-phillippe.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdeacon-reese-phillippe.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdeacon-reese-phillippe.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdeacon-reese-phillippe.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdeacon-reese-phillippe.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdeacon-reese-phillippe.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./glen-campbell-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./glen-campbell-net-worth.html>Glen Campbell Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./general-hospitals-bryan-craig-returns-as-morgan-corinthos.html>General Hospital's Bryan Craig Returns as Morgan Corinthos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./general-hospitals-bryan-craig-returns-as-morgan-corinthos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
