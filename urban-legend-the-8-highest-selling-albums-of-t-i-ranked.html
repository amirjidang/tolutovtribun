His ascent coincided with that of other <a href=#>Atlanta-based rappers such as Young Jeezy</a> and Gucci Mane. His unique style and sound made him one of the highest-selling hip hop artists of all time with a total of 12 studio albums under his belt. One of his Billboard Hot 100 Chart-topping hits was Live Your Life&nbsp;featuring the <a href=#>Caribbean music artist and entrepreneur, Rihanna</a>, from his 2008 album Paper Trail. With five platinum albums and over 14 million albums sold worldwide, here are 10 of the highest-selling albums by T.I., ranked.</p><h2 id=paper-trail---2-222-500-copies>Paper Trail - 2,222,500 Copies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the time T.I. released his sixth studio album, Paper Trail, in 2008, he was considered as being at the peak of his career. Two years earlier, he starred in his first major movie, ATL, alongside<a href=#> actress Lauren London</a> and actors Evan Ross, Jackie Long, Keith David, and Outkast rapper Big Boi. He released the album under is own record label, Grand Hustle Records, alongside Atlantic Records, debuting at No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 and selling 568,000 copies in the first week. The album went on to sell over 2 million copies and featured artists such as the rap legend Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, the controversial Kanye West,<a href=#> singer/actor Justin Timberlake</a>, John Legend, and the Fenty CEO, Rihanna.</p><h2 id=king---2-110-000-copies>KING - 2,110,000 Copies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides the name T.I., the Atlanta rap artist has also been called names like Rubber Band Man and King of the South, a title many other southern hip-hop rappers have been gunning for in the music industry. Nothing like some healthy competition, right? Well, if T.I.'s fourth studio album, KING, wasn't a loud enough statement to let the competition know where he stands, nothing else could be. The album again debuted at No.1 on The Billboard 200 chart and sold over 522,000 copies in the first week of its release, according to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Hip-Hop Database</a>. It was handled by various record producers like Just Blaze, Mannie Fresh, and <a href=#>famous beatmaker Swizz Beatz</a> to name a few and features artists such as the multitalented Jamie Foxx, Young Buck, Pharrell, Common, and actor/comedian Mike Epps.</p><h2 id=t-i-vs-t-i-p---1-050-000-copies>T.I vs T.I.P. - 1,050,000 Copies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prolific and unyielding, just one year after the release of KING, T.I. dropped his fifth studio album titled T.I. vs T.I.P. in July of 2007 under his Grand Hustle Records label and Atlantic Records. This album seemed to have even more names on the production team than his previous album. <i>T.I. vs T.I.P.</i>&nbsp;was produced by names such as Just Blaze, Wyclef Jean, Timbaland,<a href=#> rapper Eminem</a>, and Keith Mack to mention a few. One of the lead singles from the album, Big Things Poppin', (Do It) received platinum recognition and the album was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards. Altogether, T.I. vs T.I.P&nbsp;sold 1,050,000 album globally.</p><h2 id=trap-muzik---1-000-000-copies>Trap Muzik - 1,000,000 Copies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Released as one of the earlier studio albums in his career, Trap Muzic hit No. 4 on the US Billboard 200 chart and No. 2 on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums in 2003. Being his second studio album, he received production help from other artists like Kanye West, record producer Jazze Pha, and rapper, actor, and <a href=#>producer David Banner</a>. Although the song peaked at No. 30 on the US Billboard Hot 100, it was a major hit in the early-mid 2000s. Trap Muzic went on to sell a total of 1 million copies worldwide, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BestSellingAlbums.org.</a></p><h2 id=urban-legend---1-000-000-copies>Urban Legend - 1,000,000 Copies</h2><p>For many millennials who were into hip-hop at the time of T.I.'s rise to stardom, they would undoubtedly confess to being raised on many of his songs. A few of those songs were off of T.I.'s third studio album, Urban Legend, which was released in November 2004. The lead single from the album, Bring 'Em Out, debuted at No. 9 while the album's second single, U Don't Know Me, made it to No. 23 on the chart. Urban Legend featured artists such as <a href=#>fellow rapper Nelly</a>, the Bad Boy label princess Lil' Kim, Lil' Wayne, and Lil' John. According to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Hip Hop Scriptures</a>, the album sold roughly 1 million copies globally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-mercy---500-000-copies>No Mercy - 500,000 Copies</h2><p>T.I.'s seventh studio album, titled No Mercy, was released in 2010 once again under his Grand Hustle Records label. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Pitchfork</a>, the original name for the album was supposed to be King Uncaged, conveniently named as it would have featured the songs T.I. wrote while finishing a year in prison for a gun charge. Unfortunately, upon release he also was whisked back to jail after a drug arrest and parole violation at a Los Angeles traffic stop. This was where No Mercy came in to replace the initial title. Despite a list of guest features on the album such as Eminem,<a href=#> YOLO rapper Drake</a>, Christina Aguilera, and the Neptunes, the album only sold 500,000 copies in total.</p><h2 id=trouble-man-heavy-is-the-head---500-000-copies>Trouble Man: Heavy Is The Head - 500,000 Copies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>T.I. kept the needle pushing in 2012 with the release of his eighth studio album Trouble Man: Heavy Is The Head which received positive reviews from his fans. This album marked his first studio album in over four years and he was set to come out with a bang. He said that the inspiration for the name of the album came from Marvin Gaye's 1972 song with the same name. Featured on the album were <a href=#>prominent artists like Meek Mill</a>, ASAP Rocky, and rapper B.o.B. For the second time in his music career, T.I. would have an album that only sold 500,000 copies worldwide.</p><h2 id=i-m-serious---270-000-copies>I'm Serious - 270,000 Copies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even living legends like T.I. came from humble beginnings before going platinum. His very first album, I'm Serious, came out in October 2001 after spending two years in the recording stage. At the time, Tip had not founded his Grand Hustle Records label and opted to release the album through Arista Records. Despite having an array of artists featured on various songs, such as Too Short, Bone Crusher, Youngbloodz, and even the <a href=#>Jamaican dancehall artist Beenie Man</a>, the album was received poor commercial reception and only sold 165,000 copies in the United States, and 270,000 worldwide. However, hard work pays off because the 41-year old now has a net worth of $20 million and a lifetime of music to be remembered by.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:<a href=#> The 10 Highest-Selling Snoop Dogg Albums, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitchfork</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hip Hop Scriptures</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BestSellingAlbums.org</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hip-Hop Database</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTCs67Ap2SlnZeau6V506GcZnBdnbaotMSsq2arlaG5qrrGZpilmqWiwG67xWarZqFdp66vt8SdZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2furban-legend-the-8-highest-selling-albums-of-t-i-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2furban-legend-the-8-highest-selling-albums-of-t-i-ranked.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2furban-legend-the-8-highest-selling-albums-of-t-i-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2furban-legend-the-8-highest-selling-albums-of-t-i-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2furban-legend-the-8-highest-selling-albums-of-t-i-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2furban-legend-the-8-highest-selling-albums-of-t-i-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-biggest-wedding-of-2023-everything-we-know-about-sofia-richie-elliot-grainges-nuptials.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-biggest-wedding-of-2023-everything-we-know-about-sofia-richie-elliot-grainges-nuptials.html>The Biggest Wedding Of 2023: Everything We Know About Sofia Richie &amp;amp; Elliot Grainge's Nuptials</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./saedemario-age-and-real-name-revealed-facts-to-know.html>Saedemario Age And Real Name Revealed: Facts To Know</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./saedemario-age-and-real-name-revealed-facts-to-know.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
