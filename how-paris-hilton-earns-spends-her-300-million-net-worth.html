Heiress to the Hilton Hotel empire, Paris was born into the lap of luxury and her wild, larger-than-life experiences have unfolded in front of the cameras. Everything she does is of interest to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">millions of fans across the globe</a>, who are all tuned in to see what she says, buys, promotes, and of course, who she is spending her time with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being the heiress to a deep, exponentially huge fortune is not the only claim that Paris has on her multi-million dollar fortune. She has launched a series of her own product lines and engages in a variety of other ventures that generate significant income streams. As quickly as she earns her money, and adds to her $300 million net worth, Paris is equally great at spending it, and she does so in some very big ways.</p><h2 id=spends-shopping-sprees><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Spends: Shopping Sprees</span></h2><p>Most of us can only ever dream of going on shopping sprees the way Paris Hilton does. Her limitless budget allows Paris to close down any store she pleases so that she can go on a personal shopping spree.</p><p>Only the very best of everything will do, and Paris has been known to spend tens of thousands of dollars each time she feels like spoiling herself with something new. In fact, sources indicate <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she spent in excess of $5000 in less than 40 minutes</a> during a recent trip to Australia, and that was a modest, rushed shopping day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Hilton Explains The Real Reason She Always Wears Sunglasses</a></span></p><h2 id=earns-fragrance-sales><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Earns: Fragrance Sales</span></h2><p>One of the ways Paris Hilton pads her pockets is through the sale of her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wide selection of perfumes</a>. Her brand has created fragrances such as Electrify, Dazzle, Fairy Dust, Tease, and Siren, each with their own signature aroma, and all backed by a team of people hovering around Paris to create the perfect marketing campaigns. She promotes her brand at every opportunity and rakes in the dough.</p><h2 id=spends-private-jets><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Spends: Private Jets</span></h2><p>When Paris Hilton travels, commercial airlines simply won't do. Paris' need for luxurious surroundings and exclusive experiences means she spends a whole lot of money on private jets. She takes advantage of the corporate jet belonging to the Hilton empire, but is also known to drop big bucks on jets, on a whim, to take her to wherever she feels like going in uber-style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earns-event-appearances><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Earns: Event Appearances</span></h2><p>When you're Paris Hilton, all you have to do to get paid is show up.

She also owns a penthouse in one of New York's most prestigious areas, which is valued at a jaw-dropping $4.9 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earns-movies-and-modeling><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Earns :&nbsp;Movies And Modeling</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Much of Paris Hilton's wealth is self-made</a>. She has appeared in 21 movies, such as This Is Paris, House Of Wax, and The Cat In The Hat, and has a number of modeling contracts under her belt. She has walked the runway during New York Fashion Week and has modeled for Colcci. According to Paper, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her modeling career never turned into a full-time gig</a>, but she has definitely been noticed each time she's graced a stage.</p><h2 id=spends-fast-cars><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Spends: Fast Cars</span></h2><p>When it comes to her cars, Paris Hilton likes them pink!

Her handbags and shoes are top sellers across the globe.</p><h2 id=spends-houses-for-her-dogs><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Spends: Houses...
