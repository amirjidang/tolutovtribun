It’s unclear if this secret organization that allegedly influences world affairs and has many prominent personalities as its members is still in existence today. But because it’s appeared in dozens of entertainment mediums, it’s heavily associated with celebrities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many enthusiasts believe that the secret organization has masterminded many of the most controversial deaths in history. Some of the political figures that purportedly died by the hand of the Illuminati were John F. Kennedy, Jr., his brother Robert, Abraham Lincoln, and even Princess Diana. Yes, these theories sound absolutely absurd and we don’t know if there’s any truth to it.</p><p>But how about we take a look at the celebrities who were rumored to have been rid of by the Illuminati? This is purely speculation, but conspiracy theories are so interesting to ponder on, aren’t they?</p><h2 id=cory-monteith>Cory Monteith</h2><p>The Glee star had just completed his rehabilitation treatment for his battle with drugs and he was supposedly sober and clean already. Which is why it came as a shock when reports surfaced that <a title="Cory Monteith Net Worth" href=#>Cory Monteith</a> was found dead in a Vancouver hotel room in July 2013, apparently of a drug and alcohol overdose. Illuminati watchdogs claimed that his death was simply a ritual sacrifice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=anna-nicole-smith>Anna Nicole Smith</h2><p>In her short, but tumultuous life, <a title="Anna Nicole Smith Net Worth" href=#>Anna Nicole Smith</a> experienced many hardships, the worst tragedy of which was the death of her son. It was said that she never quite recovered from his demise and a few months later, she died of an apparent drug overdose. Many chalked it up to depression, but Illuminati theorists believe that her death was one of the ritual sacrifices of the organization.</p><p></p><h2 id=john-lennon>John Lennon</h2><p>It appears that <a title="John Lennon Net Worth" href=#>John Lennon</a> made many controversial statements that got him into trouble, to the point that he was considered a threat by the INS and FBI, which had him under surveillance. Illuminati theorists believed that his assassin, crazed fan Mark David Chapman, was ordered by the organization to kill Lennon to silence him.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amy-winehouse>Amy Winehouse</h2><p>She was as talented as she was troubled. For years, <a title="Amy Winehouse Net Worth" href=#>Amy Winehouse</a> struggled with alcohol and drug addiction and in one of her last concerts before her death, she was even slurring and stumbling onstage, clearly under the influence. The concert didn’t push through as scheduled and this put a dent on her career. Winehouse was said to have spoken out about a member of the Illuminati trying to make her into the shape of a triangle, the Illuminati symbol, which she didn’t agree to. She died of a drug and alcohol overdose in 2011.</p><p></p><h2 id=kurt-cobain>Kurt Cobain</h2><p>Nirvana lead singer <a title="Kurt Cobain Net Worth" href=#>Kurt Cobain</a> was said to have been involved with the Illuminati in the sense that they wanted to use him for their mind-control experiments and studies. Cobain showed a lot of skepticism in the procedure and was reluctant to participate. Because of insubordination, he was viewed as a threat and he died from a gunshot wound on April 1994. It was ruled a suicide, but many tend to wonder if that was an accurate conclusion.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=whitney-houston>Whitney Houston</h2><p><a title="Whitney Houston Net Worth" href=#>Whitney Houston</a>’s death was a shocker, though many weren’t surprised by the cause: a drug overdose. Houston had been battling with drug addiction for many years before her death, but it was believed that she had already sobered up. Rumor has it that she was rid of as blood sacrifice of the Illuminati, though the reasons of why the members supposedly wanted her gone are unclear.</p><p></p><h2 id=brittany-murphy>Brittany Murphy</h2><p>She gained recognition in the teen flick Clueless, after which she went on to do more serious roles. But <a title="Brittany Murphy Net Worth" href=#>Brittany Murphy</a> was perhaps featured most prominently in the news when she suddenly collapsed and died under mysterious circumstances. After an examination, it was said that her cause of death was pneumonia and anemia, but when her husband mysteriously died a few months later, a toxicology report showed that the couple’s home contained a high level of toxic mold in its foundation. But Illuminati theorists claim that the poisonous stuff may have been put there on purpose.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aaliyah>Aaliyah</h2><p>Just when her music career was taking off and her future seemed so bright, 22-year-old R&B singer<a title="Aaliyah Net Worth" href=#> Aaliyah</a> died in a plane crash. She and her entourage perished not long after taking off from the Bahamas. Illuminati fanatics believe that the singer may have been sacrificed by the organization so that fellow R&B up-and-coming star, <a title="Beyonce Illuminati" href=#>Beyonce</a>, who’s said to be a member of the elite circle, could rise to stardom without any competition.</p><p></p><h2 id=philip-seymour-hoffman>Philip Seymour Hoffman</h2><p>Like many of his fellow actors, <a title="Philip Seymour Hoffman Net Worth" href=#>Philip Seymour Hoffman</a> succumbed to death from a drug overdose in his New York City apartment. It’s said that when the Illuminati are out to make blood sacrifices, they usually target individuals who are already struggling with drug and alcohol addiction. Seymour Hoffman was certainly an easy target if it’s true that he fell victim to the organization.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-jackson>Michael Jackson</h2><p>Purported to be an Illuminati member, the king of pop may have gotten on the organization’s bad side when he started speaking out against them and how they were trying to control the music industry. <a title="Michael Jackson Net Worth" href=#>Michael Jackson</a> also said that there was a conspiracy to destroy his name by labeling him a pedophile. His words may have caused him his life because on June 2009, Jackson was found dead of an apparent drug overdose in his home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmpoXZiyrbHBZpuemaSdwG6%2BxKWYrZ2UYsGwedOhnGahnKHCrrXNmquiZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celeb-deaths-related-to-the-illuminati.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-celeb-deaths-related-to-the-illuminati.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-celeb-deaths-related-to-the-illuminati.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-celeb-deaths-related-to-the-illuminati.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celeb-deaths-related-to-the-illuminati.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celeb-deaths-related-to-the-illuminati.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./people-who-openly-dislike-tom-cruise-and-those-who-adore-him.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./people-who-openly-dislike-tom-cruise-and-those-who-adore-him.html>14 People Who Openly Dislike Tom Cruise (5 Who Adore Him)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./real-housewives-of-dallas-which-housewife-has-the-highest-net-worth.html>'Real Housewives of Dallas': Which Housewife Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./real-housewives-of-dallas-which-housewife-has-the-highest-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
