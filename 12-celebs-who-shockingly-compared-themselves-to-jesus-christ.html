It takes a hell of a lot of nerve to draw parallels between your life and the existence of a prominent religious figure. Unless you're saying that you both have names that start with "J," it is just such a crazy idea to compare yourself to Jesus. It is embarrassing and egotistical in all honesty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But it does happen. There are plenty of people who think that they are living their lives the way Jesus did. And no one believes this more than a celebrity with a giant ego. I will never get over anyone thinking they are at all like Jesus Christ, but there are lots of stars who think that similarities exist.</p><p>There have been some crazy Jesus comparisons made by some major stars over the years. These people have used&nbsp;Jesus metaphors to describe their struggles,&nbsp;strapped&nbsp;their bodies onto giant crosses, given themselves Jesus-inspired nicknames, and reenacted the Last Supper.</p><p>These 12&nbsp;celebrities had the nerve to compare themselves to Jesus Christ.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-kanye-west---makes-too-many-jesus-references-to-keep-track><strong>12. Kanye West - Makes Too Many Jesus References To Keep Track</strong></h2><p>Of course, <a href=#>Kanye West</a> is included in this list. I live for everything Kanye does and I have to admit that I have been very entertained by his blatant Jesus complex over the years. Everyone knows that he has been living as his Jesus-inspired alter ego Yeezus for a long time now. He even had a Yeezus album and concert tour. He even wore a crown of thorns just like Jesus in some of the Yeezus album artwork. Kanye has made many biblical references in his songs as well. He really believes that he is the second coming in the music industry. <a href=#>Kanye also rocked the Jesus look on the cover of Rolling Stone</a> when he wore the crown of thorns, fake blood, and simulated bruises. At this point it is possible that Kanye does think that he is Jesus.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber---wants-to-live-like-jesus><strong>Justin Bieber - Wants To Live Like Jesus</strong></h2><h2></h2><p>I never thought that I would say this, but I am a Belieber. <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>'s latest album is fire. But even with all that going for him, the dude had a lot to overcome&nbsp;to revamp his public image. The dude did a lot of offensive stuff so now pretty much every thing he says is highly scrutinized. It honestly seems like <a href=#>Justin had the best intentions</a> with this quote and was not acting conceited when he said, "I do not want to shove this down anyone’s throat. I just wanna honestly live like Jesus. Not be Jesus -- I could never -- I don’t want that to come across weird. He created a pretty awesome template of how to love people and how to be gracious and kind." I just think things went a little far when he elaborated on this, "Sometimes when I don’t feel like doing something, but I know it’s right, I remember, I’m pretty sure Jesus didn’t feel like going to the cross and dying so that we don’t have to feel what we should have to feel." That last part went a little far, but I really feel that the Biebs had the best intentions with his words.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-chris-brown---referenced-jesus-over-a-parking-spot><strong>10. Chris Brown - Referenced Jesus Over A Parking Spot</strong></h2><p>Just call him Christ Brown. The controversial singer <a href=#>got in a fight with Frank Ocean</a> over a parking space and apparently things got out of hand. <a href=#>Frank Ocean</a> even tweeted about the incident and said, "Got jumped by chris and a couple guys. lol. Cut my finger now I can't play w two hands at the Grammys." You figured that <a href=#>Chris Brown</a> would be used to the bad press by now, but he was pretty sensitive when it came to this issue. Chris Instagrammed an image of Jesus Christ on the cross and captioned it with "Painting the way I feel today. Focus on what matters!" This seems like a pretty extreme comparison when it comes to an altercation over a parking spot.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-nicki-minaj---thinks-she-s-the-martyr-in-hip-hop><strong>9.&nbsp;Nicki Minaj - Thinks She's The&nbsp;Martyr In Hip Hop</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> is one of my favorite rappers. Not only that, but she is a great celebrity because she is always popping off. The woman says the darnedest thing and never has any qualms about sharing her opinions about anything. And for the most part she can back up anything she says because she is just such a talented artist. Well, this is true for the most part. Nicki's lyrics got a little bit more controversial than usual <a href=#>in her song "Freedom"</a> when she rapped, “They’ll never thank me for opening doors / But they ain’t even thank Jesus when he died on the cross / Cause your spirit is ungrateful, b*tches is so hateful, I remain a staple." I'm not sure if comparing herself to Jesus was exactly on mark, but she really did open up doors for a lot of women in hip hop, so I can see what she was getting at.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-michael-jordan---thinks-he-s-black-jesus><strong>8. Michael Jordan - Thinks He's "Black Jesus"</strong></h2><p>Aside from being a fan of his skill on the court, any story that has to do with <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a>'s bravado and ego always makes me feel some type of way. I just cannot get enough of his ego. It has always kept me thoroughly entertained. I also love hearing the behind-the-scenes dirt when it comes to athletes' interactions with each other. So it really gave me life when I heard a story about <a href=#>Reggie Miller and Michael Jordan trash talking</a> for the first time and the anecdote ended with this, "And as he's walking off, he's like, 'Be sure, and be careful that you never talk to Black Jesus like that. OK?' 'OK! I'm so sorry, Black Jesus! I'm so sorry!'" And I can't explain why, but for some weird reason I don't find that offensive. MJ is the only person who can actually pull off that kind of thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-jared-leto---posted-many-instagrams-comparing-himself-to-jesus><strong>7. Jared Leto - Posted MANY Instagrams Comparing Himself To Jesus</strong></h2><p>I'm not gonna lie, I too have made Jesus comparisons whenever I saw <a href=#>Jared Leto</a> with long hair. It really is a similar hairstyle. Nevertheless, it is a little bit cringeworthy to see someone post a side-by-side photo of himself&nbsp;and Jesus Christ. He captioned one of them with <a href=#>"#NotComparingToChrist,"</a> but I don't get it. How can you pic stitch a photo of you and Jesus and have it not be a comparison. Clearly he was alluding to some kind of parallels with that one. And it wasn't the first or last time that Jared Leto channeled Jesus on Instagram. He posted another photo with his arms spread out <a href=#>with the caption </a>"Last night we went to church." To say the least, Jared Leto has some sort of Jesus fixation. And it's all just a little too much for me.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-madonna---nailed-herself-to-a-cross-at-her-concerts><strong>6. Madonna - Nailed Herself To A Cross At Her Concerts</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Madonna </a>is no stranger to starting an uproar. In fact, she is the queen of controversy. During her 2006 Confessions world tour, <a href=#>Madonna wore a crown of thorns</a> and sang her song "Live to Tell" while she hung on a giant cross with her arms stretched out just like Jesus Christ. To this day, I don't really know what to make of this performance and I still do not really get the point that she was trying to make, but she definitely got a lot of attention and stirred up a ton of drama. Was Madonna implying that her music made her a martyr for the people? I love me some Madonna, but this whole display was just pointless and crass.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-charlie-sheen---compared-himself-to-jesus-in-a-tweet><strong>5. Charlie Sheen - Compared Himself To Jesus In A Tweet</strong></h2><p>I feel like we should all be used to <a href=#>Charlie Sheen</a> saying crazy shit at this point, but he still manages to shock us pretty often with his ludicrous statements. It just seems like this thought came out of nowhere though. During a 2013 trip to Ireland, <a href=#>Charlie Sheen tweeted </a>a photo of himself with his arms spread out similar to Jesus on the cross and captions it with "And on the 1st night Jesus saved Ireland #emasculated misconception." In a smart move, it looks like that tweet has since been deleted, but it will never be forgotten. The comparison came out of nowhere with zero parallels or similarities. It just made no sense at all. Aside from mimicking Jesus's body language, I have no idea where the dude was coming from. But then again, who ever does?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-lindsay-lohan---posed-as-jesus-on-a-magazine-cover><strong>4. Lindsay Lohan - Posed As Jesus On A Magazine Cover</strong></h2><p>I might be one of the few people who are still rooting for <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> to have a comeback, but I don't care. I've always had a soft spot for the actress. But when I saw the photo of <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan wearing a crown of thorns</a> with her arms stretched out like Jesus on the cross, it was way too much for me. I don't know if she was trying to symbolize her rebirth from the slums of a has-been actress to the comeback queen she desires to be, but the imagery went way too far. It was definitely not a great PR move by any means.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-scott-disick---reimagined-the-last-supper><strong>3. Scott Disick - Reimagined The Last Supper</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Scott Disick</a> is the best part of Keeping Up With The Kardashians. He has the best one-liners and his sense of self importance is super humorous. I am all about him acting like he's actually royalty and going by the moniker Lord Disick. He really cracks me up. But he took his act a little far when he posted a <a href=#>photoshopped image of Jesus's Last Supper </a>with himself taking on the role of Jesus and all of the Kardashians, Jenners, <a href=#>Lamar Odom</a>, and even <a href=#>Kris Humphries</a> sitting in the rest of the seats. As much as I adore Scott, the joke just really didn't land.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-nas---got-dragged-to-crucifixion-while-rapping><strong>2.&nbsp;Nas - &nbsp;Got Dragged To Crucifixion&nbsp;While Rapping</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Nas </a>has never been afraid to push the envelope, but a lot of people thought that he took things too far when he tried to embody <a href=#>Jesus in his music video for the song "Hate Me Now."</a> He rocked that crown of Thorns and even rapped as he was hanging off of a giant cross. The video even showed Nas rapping along to his song as he was literally dragged across the ground en route to crucifixion. Referring to the video as "controversial" would be the understatement of the century. I don't care how many haters you think you're up against, comparing yourself to Jesus Christ will never actually make sense.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-vicki-gunvalson---compared-herself-to-jesus-on-the-cross><strong>1. Vicki Gunvalson - Compared Herself To Jesus On The Cross</strong></h2><p>Usually, I only have the chance to talk about Real Housewives with a select friends of mine, but this year a story line on The Real Housewives of Orange County ended up making major headlines. <a href=#>Vicki Gunvalson's boyfriend Brook Ayers was accused of faking cancer</a> the entire season and everyone was captivated by it. Not only did they want to know the truth about his medical situation, but people wanted to know what Vicki really knew the whole time. Obviously, she endured a lot of scrutiny, so much so that she had the nerve to say "I'm being nailed to the cross like Jesus was" at a baptism of all occasions. It made a bad situation so much worse for the Housewife. Just when I thought she could not get any more negative attention, she brought it upon herself. That's about the farthest someone could be from a #TotalJesusMove if you ask me.</p><p><strong>Sources</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=#>www.dailymail.co.uk;</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>www.mtv.com</a>;&nbsp;<a href=#>www.huffingtonpost.com</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmpqXZiyrbHBrGSwoJ9iwKm7wqSgp5%2Bcrnqku8ypmKudlGLBqbHMrJylrpWoerW7jKOcrK2jYrCpvsisq2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f12-celebs-who-shockingly-compared-themselves-to-jesus-christ.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f12-celebs-who-shockingly-compared-themselves-to-jesus-christ.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f12-celebs-who-shockingly-compared-themselves-to-jesus-christ.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f12-celebs-who-shockingly-compared-themselves-to-jesus-christ.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f12-celebs-who-shockingly-compared-themselves-to-jesus-christ.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f12-celebs-who-shockingly-compared-themselves-to-jesus-christ.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./4x4-barbie-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-41125-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./4x4-barbie-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-41125-html.html>44 Barbie Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./408200-10-highest-paid-radio-presenters-kenya-salaries-html.html>10 highest-paid radio presenters in Kenya and their salaries</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./408200-10-highest-paid-radio-presenters-kenya-salaries-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
