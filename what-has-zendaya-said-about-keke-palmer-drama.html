She has also acknowledged the privilege that comes with being a light-skinned black woman and has used her platform to highlight these issues.</p><p>She's directly affected, some fans opposed her being <a href=#>cast as Spider-Man's love interest</a> in the franchise because she's black.</p><p>Nevertheless, the 25-year-old forged her own path and is thriving on both the big and small screens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=on-being-39-hollywood-39-s-acceptable-version-of-a-black-girl-39>On Being 'Hollywood's Acceptable Version Of A Black Girl'</h2><p>Zendaya got her big break at 14 years old on the Disney Channel. She starred in Shake It Up alongside Bella Thorne and became a household name. She's since featured in several productions like Euphoria and even made it to the MCU as Michelle "MJ" Jones in the Spider-Man franchise.</p><p>Not only that but she's made a name for herself and is currently one of the biggest stars in the industry.</p><p>Her career hasn't been without its challenges, <a href=#>the star was once forced out of Lifetime's Aaliyah biopic by fans</a>. Fans were opposed to the idea, so much so that they started a petition to have the role recast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some comments pointed out how the Disney alum looked nothing like Aaliyah and wondered why the role wasn't awarded to someone else. The star dropped out of the movie, citing an issue with the production value. Over the years, some fans have alluded to Zendaya being "Hollywood's token Black girl."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking at the Beauty Con Festival,</a> the Euphoria star revealed, "As a black woman, as a light-skinned black woman, it’s important that I’m using my privilege, my platform to show you how much beauty there is in the African-American community. I am Hollywood’s, I guess you could say, acceptable version of a black girl, and that has to change."</p><p>She told the audience, "We’re vastly too beautiful and too interesting for me to just be the only representation of that. What I’m saying, it’s about creating those opportunities, sometimes. You have to create those paths. And that’s with anything, Hollywood, art, whatever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zendaya-uses-her-influence-for-good>Zendaya Uses Her Influence For Good</h2><p>It's evident that Zendaya is passionate about issues affecting the black community and has often used her influence to shine a light on some of those issues. The actress acknowledges how being a light-skinned black woman accords her some privilege, and hasn't shied away from publicly voicing her opinion on that.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She told Cosmopolitan</a>, "I feel a responsibility to be a voice for the beautiful shades my people come in. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a privilege compared to my darker sisters and brothers."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Alicia Keys Sparks Debate On Whether 'Pretty Privilege' Is Real</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added, "Like people question, Would you listen to Zendaya if she wasn’t the same skin color? And that’s an honest question. Can I honestly say that I’ve had to face the same racism and struggles as a woman with darker skin? No, I cannot."</p><p>Zendaya went on to say, "I have not walked in her shoes and that is unfair of me to say. But I’m completely behind that woman. I want to be a part of the movement and growth. And if I get put in a position because of the color of my skin where people will listen to me, then I should use that privilege the right way."</p><h2 id=some-fans-didn-39-t-want-zendaya-to-play-mj-because-she-39-s-black>Some Fans Didn't Want Zendaya To Play MJ Because She's Black</h2><p>When news of Zendaya starring in Spider-Man: Homecoming broke in 2016, some fans weren't open to the idea of a Black "MJ." They took to social media to express their displeasure with the choice of actress.</p><p>Once again, the majority of the critics cited the difference in appearance between the "original" iteration of Mary Jane to Zendaya.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite Mary Jane being a fictional character, some angered fans were fixated on the character's race and refused to accept a black woman playing role.</p><p>One Twitter user wrote, "Since Mary Jane is being played by a black woman, can MLK be played by a White man in a next movie about him?"</p><p>Another one said, "Zendaya being the next Mary Jane is just wrong. Mary Jane is not black. Why can't Hollywood ever stick to the story? smh."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Filming 'Spider-Man 3' Was 'Bittersweet' For Zendaya</a></span></p><p>However, not everyone was opposed to the then 19-year-old portraying MJ. Writer and director, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Gunn, came to Zendaya's defense </a>in a lengthy Facebook post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He wrote, "… Yesterday, a rumor broke out that the character of Mary Jane was being played by a young black woman, Zendaya, and all hell broke out on the Internet (again). I tweeted that if people find themselves complaining about Mary Jane's ethnicity they have lives that are too good…"</p><p>He added, "… Whatever the case, if we're going to continue to make movies based on the almost all white heroes and supporting characters from the comics of the last century, we're going to have to get used to them being more reflective of our diverse present world. Perhaps we can be open to the idea that, although someone may not initially match how we personally conceive a character, we can be - and often are - happily surprised."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWiv4yznKecka6ubr%2FAoptmmZKkwrV5yp6inmWglrmusdFmm6uZnZZ8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-has-zendaya-said-about-keke-palmer-drama.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-has-zendaya-said-about-keke-palmer-drama.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-has-zendaya-said-about-keke-palmer-drama.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-has-zendaya-said-about-keke-palmer-drama.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-has-zendaya-said-about-keke-palmer-drama.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-has-zendaya-said-about-keke-palmer-drama.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-are-nikos-kilcher-parents-wiki-biography-age-wedding-net-worth-523279-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-are-nikos-kilcher-parents-wiki-biography-age-wedding-net-worth-523279-html.html>Who are Nikos Kilcher parents?
