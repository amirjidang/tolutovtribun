This is in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, where young people had less opportunity to wear makeup due to widespread lockdowns and social distancing measures.

In the video posted to TikTok, the star showed how to achieve the look. The lip combo is based around Hailey's signature lip technique, which is lining her lips with a deep brown lip liner before adding a glossy lip balm on top.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hailey-bieber-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The look was widely criticized on social media, with many people expressing concern about the cultural insensitivity of wearing a lip color that was often associated with Black and Latino culture. Critics argued that the "brownie glazed lip" look reflected a lack of understanding about the history and cultural significance of certain beauty trends. Some pointed out that similar lip looks have been popularized and worn by Black women for decades, and that Hailey Bieber's interpretation of the look was a prime example of cultural appropriation.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Best Moments From WHO'S IN MY BATHROOM?!

We had to be creative and try things in an unorthodox way because of the lack of products for Black and Brown people."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hailey-bieber-and-keke-palmer-on-whos-in-my-bathroom-youtube-series.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also expressed that the celebration of the look as a "new trend" due to it being popularized by a white celebrity wasn't appropriate, writing: "everyone feels like they found gold for the first time. That's why we need to look and say 'hey, we've been here."</p><p>Meanwhile, others defended Hailey and brought up the fact that her mother is Brazilian, and may have inspired her beauty aesthetic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqGcmsZursiemZ6qXaOuqrjSZqqkoZ6YrrOxjKumrqyZo7JuucCdnGaglad6qLHNZrFmoZOku3A%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhailey-bieber-nails-skincare-routine-made-her-gen-z-icon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhailey-bieber-nails-skincare-routine-made-her-gen-z-icon.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhailey-bieber-nails-skincare-routine-made-her-gen-z-icon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhailey-bieber-nails-skincare-routine-made-her-gen-z-icon.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhailey-bieber-nails-skincare-routine-made-her-gen-z-icon.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhailey-bieber-nails-skincare-routine-made-her-gen-z-icon.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-old-is-cindy-silva-kevin-costners-first-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-old-is-cindy-silva-kevin-costners-first-wife.html>How Old Is Cindy Silva, Kevin Costners First Wife?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./heres-the-trailer-for-theo-vons-netflix-standup-special-no-offense-html.html>Heres the Trailer for Theo Vons Netflix Standup Special No Offense</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./heres-the-trailer-for-theo-vons-netflix-standup-special-no-offense-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
