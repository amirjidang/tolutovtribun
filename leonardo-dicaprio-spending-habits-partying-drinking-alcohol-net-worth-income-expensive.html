DiCaprio has made millions, and he once dropped $3 million on something that people were utterly surprised by.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at Leonardo DiCaprio and see what he casually spent millions on.</p><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio-is-a-living-legend>Leonardo DiCaprio Is A Living Legend</h2><p>Having been involved in successful projects since the 1990s, Leonardo DiCaprio is an actor that movie fans around the world are familiar with. DiCaprio had success on the small screen earlier on, but once he got the chance to shine in major movies, he blossomed into a powerhouse and never looked back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his time on the big screen, Leonardo DiCaprio has earned rave reviews for his best performances and has been instrumental in a number of films conquering the box office. His list of credits rivals anyone from his era, and if he decided to never appear in a movie for the rest of his life, he can be sure that his legacy will never wane. The younger actors coming up now should be looking at his career and taking notes.</p><p>Thanks to decades of success in the entertainment industry, Leonardo DiCaprio has amassed an impressive net worth that has made him one of the richest leading men in Hollywood history.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio Lost Out On A Role To Appear Alongside Tom Cruise And Brad Pitt</a></span></p><h2 id=he-has-a-net-worth-of-260-million>He Has A Net Worth Of $260 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Leonardo DiCaprio is currently sporting a net worth of $260 million. A quarter of a billion dollars is an amount of money that the vast majority will never sniff in their lifetime, and DiCaprio has pulled this off thanks to his brilliant work on the big screen.</p><p>DiCaprio's movie career has made him a mint, of course, but the actor has had other endeavors that have paid off, as well.</p><p>"In the 25 years between 1995 and 2020, Leonardo DiCaprio has earned north of $300 million from salaries and backend points alone. For example, though he earned just $2.5 million in base salary from 1997's Titanic, he eventually earned $40 million thanks to 1.8% cut of gross backend points. He has also earned additional tens of millions from endorsements, real estate investments and venture capital stakes," Celebrity Net Worth reports.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The second part of the write-up is key, as it shows the actor's ability to generate millions without having to be on set for months on end. It's an impressive ability, and it's one that has lined his pockets even further.</p><p>With this type of net worth, it should not be too surprising to learn that the actor has casually spent millions on luxuries most people would never even consider.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Angelina Jolie Turned Down A Role With Leonardo DiCaprio Because Of This Person</a></span></p><h2 id=he-spent-3-million-on-champagne>He Spent $3 Million On Champagne</h2><p>So, what in the world did Leonardo DiCaprio drop a whopping $3 million for? Well, when you're as rich as he is, spending millions of dollars on champagne for a birthday party is clearly not that big of a deal, though to the rest of us, that is simply ludicrous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Drinks Business</a>, "The Darby is a hot spot in New York’s West Village and DiCaprio was joined by a host of other A-list celebrities for his birthday, including Beyonce Knowles and her husband Jay-Z, Harry Potter actress Emma Watson and Cameron Diaz. A whole host of other famous faces were also at the party."</p><p>In total, DiCaprio would spend a fortune to make sure that his guests were happily hydrated with something that could help lighten the mood.</p><p>"He and his crew spent $3 million on Armand de Brignac. They ordered 18 cases, then requested more bottles," a source said.</p><p>This type of champagne can sell for up to $250,000 per bottle, which is a ridiculous number. Thankfully, all was not lost here, as millions of dollars that were generated here were subsequently donated to The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation and the Red Cross, and it as used to help people who were affected by Hurricane Sandy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jeff Bezos’ Girlfriend Posts Tone-Deaf Instagram Message After Viral Video With Leonardo DiCaprio</a></span></p><p>Millions of dollars is not a whole lot in the world of the rich and famous, and DiCaprio's $3 million champagne haul certainly has to make people wonder what else the wealthy have casually spent a fortune on.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About Leonardo DiCaprio And Jennifer Lawrence's Relationship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijnqeelr%2Blu4ydoJyZoKe2sHnSqZynnJmjtG60wJugratdpa6zwNiipaBllKe2r7fIp55mmZyYvKm7y2alnqxdrLyzwMdmoKebn6KybrHXqZynq5mrsnA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fleonardo-dicaprio-spending-habits-partying-drinking-alcohol-net-worth-income-expensive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fleonardo-dicaprio-spending-habits-partying-drinking-alcohol-net-worth-income-expensive.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fleonardo-dicaprio-spending-habits-partying-drinking-alcohol-net-worth-income-expensive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fleonardo-dicaprio-spending-habits-partying-drinking-alcohol-net-worth-income-expensive.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fleonardo-dicaprio-spending-habits-partying-drinking-alcohol-net-worth-income-expensive.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fleonardo-dicaprio-spending-habits-partying-drinking-alcohol-net-worth-income-expensive.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./love-is-blinds-jessica-vestal-has-considered-removing-implants.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./love-is-blinds-jessica-vestal-has-considered-removing-implants.html>Love Is Blinds Jessica Vestal Has Considered Removing Implants</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lenny-marcus-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html>Lenny Marcus Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lenny-marcus-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
