So, of course, I loved her right away!”</p><p>Doherty was “a rebel” and “non-conformist who lived life on her terms,” McCord wrote.</p><p>“This is threatening to those who bend to trends, something I couldn’t see her ever doing. I didn’t spend a great deal of time with her, but I didn’t have to,” she continued. “She was who she was in all arenas. Authentic through and through. And she was a fighter. To the very end.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed on Sunday, July 14, that <a href=#>Doherty died at age 53</a> following a lengthy battle with cancer.</p><p>“It is with a heavy heart that I confirm the passing of actress Shannen Doherty. On Saturday, July 13, she lost her battle with cancer after many years of fighting the disease,” her publicist, <strong>Leslie Sloane</strong>, shared in a statement. “The devoted daughter, sister, aunt and friend was surrounded by her loved ones as well as her dog, Bowie. The family asks for their privacy at this time so they can grieve in peace.”</p><p>Doherty was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015. While she was in remission, the disease came back in 2017. By 2023, Doherty announced that cancer had spread to her bones and eventually her brain.</p><p>The actress famously played Brenda Walsh on the original iteration of Beverly Hills, 90210, which aired from 1990 to 2000. She reprised her role in 2008 for The CW reboot of the show, which aired from 2008 to 2013.</p><p>“I didn’t know her well. I don’t even know if she remembered meeting me, but the impact that she had on me has lasted the 15 years that it’s been since my interaction with her,” 90210 reboot star <strong>Shenae Grimes</strong> (Annie Wilson) shared in <a href=#>her own Instagram statement</a> on Sunday. “My character on the spinoff of the show definitely represented her character [Brenda Walsh] on the original 90210 because I was part of the brother-sister duo that moved from the small town to Beverly Hills.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added: “Shannen was always my favorite, probably because of the brunette locks.”</p><p>Grimes recalled Doherty giving her “the warmest smile and the biggest hug” before they acted together.</p><p>“When she hugged me, like, I just felt like, ‘You’ve been here. You know what this is on, like, an even larger scale than I possibly could have experienced,’” Grimes continued. “It just made me feel like, ‘I’m OK. She got out unscathed from this crazy, wild ride and she’s here,’ and I just felt really seen and comforted and cared for in that moment.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGZyaGJmfW6%2BxJumqKyjYq6vusClsKemlWK6pK%2FOq5tmqpWisq6uxKuqZp6ZnLW1sdFmqqGZnqOyr3nDqJ%2BeqqSufA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f90210-reboots-annalynne-mccord-remembers-fighter-shannen-doherty.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f90210-reboots-annalynne-mccord-remembers-fighter-shannen-doherty.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f90210-reboots-annalynne-mccord-remembers-fighter-shannen-doherty.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f90210-reboots-annalynne-mccord-remembers-fighter-shannen-doherty.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f90210-reboots-annalynne-mccord-remembers-fighter-shannen-doherty.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f90210-reboots-annalynne-mccord-remembers-fighter-shannen-doherty.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./a-look-into-married-life-of-dean-graziosi-and-his-wife-lisa-palacios-376151-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./a-look-into-married-life-of-dean-graziosi-and-his-wife-lisa-palacios-376151-html.html>A Look Into Married Life Of Dean Graziosi And His Wife Lisa Palacios</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./7-awesome-tv-shows-cancelled-too-soon-and-8-that-wont-go-away.html>7 Awesome TV Shows Cancelled Too Soon (And 8 That Won't Go Away)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./7-awesome-tv-shows-cancelled-too-soon-and-8-that-wont-go-away.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
