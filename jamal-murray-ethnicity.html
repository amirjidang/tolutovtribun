He’s well-known for being a key player for the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Denver Nuggets</a> in the NBA.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>People really like him because he’s very good at basketball, can do lots of different things on the court, and is great in clutch situations. Jamal’s basketball journey began when he was in Kitchener, Ontario.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He fell in love with the game when he was young. He went to Grand River Collegiate Institute, and he was so good at playing that college and pro scouts noticed him.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After a fantastic high school career, he decided to go to the United States to play college basketball for the University of Kentucky. During his one season at Kentucky, Jamal showed everyone how good he was at scoring points and staying cool under pressure.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He averaged 20 points per game and helped his team get to the Elite Eight in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NCAA Tournament</a>. His great playing got him into the 2016 NBA Draft, and he was picked as the seventh overall player by the Denver Nuggets.

They moved to Canada when they were nine years old.</span></p><p><span>Jamal’s dad, Roger, taught him about the idea that having a strong mind is really important from a very young age. He talked about this in an interview with the Denver Post in 2017:</span></p><p><span>“In the early days, we used to always work on his form with free throws and jump shots. So he’d be at the free-throw line and would sometimes get frustrated because he wouldn’t make a shot. I told him he had to make 30 in a row. So he’s 7 years old and he has to make 30 in a row. There’s some frustration and some pressure. … For me it was proving to him that he could do it, that it was mind over matter.”</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Frank Rubio Ethnicity: Discovering the Astronaut Whose Ethnicity Made History!</strong></a></p><h2><span>Jamal Murray’s Bond with His Father: Exploring the Heartwarming Connection Between the NBA Star and His Dad!!</span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Jamal-Murray-with-parents-dad-and-mom-john-calipari.png alt="jamal murray ethnicity" width=900 height=656 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jamal Murray</a> has a great relationship with both his parents, but he’s especially close to his dad. His father is not just a parent but also a coach, trainer, and friend.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Some people might think his dad pushed him into basketball, but that’s not true. Before Jamal’s second year in college, his dad said he saw his son as someone amazing:</span></p><p><span>“I saw him as almost superhuman. I watched how he approached things mentally, and how committed he was to things he wanted to do. He would never give up and never put any blocks in the way to stop him from doing whatever he was trying to do. Whatever my boy wants to do. I’m going to help him be the very best at it. … It happened to be basketball that he loved.”</span></p><p><span>Jamal Murray is a fantastic Canadian <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NBA</a> player and the only Jamaican-Canadian in the league.
