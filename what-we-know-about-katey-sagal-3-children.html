It was the first major screen role that the actress had ever portrayed. Since then, Sagal has undertaken several roles both in television and film, with her standout roles being those in <a href=#>the TV series Sons of Anarchy</a> and Married With Children. Most recently, she played the titular role in the television series Rebel, released in 2021. In the series, Sagal portrayed the role of Annie “Rebel” Bello. The series followed the eventful life of a fearless legal advocate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Katey Sagal Once Handled A Troll Who Boycotted Her Show</a></span></p><p>In recent years Sagal has also embraced the role of "the quirky mother" on-screen, through her roles as Hailey Steinfeld's mother, Katherine in the 2015 film, Pitch Perfect 2, and leading man Andy Samberg’s mother, Karen Peralta in the comedy cop series, Brooklyn Nine-Nine. However, the trope seems to be fitting for the actress as she also undertakes the role off-screen as the mother of her three children. Here’s everything we know about the Sagal children.</p><h2 id=they-don-rsquo-t-all-share-the-same-father><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Don’t All Share The Same Father</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s no secret that Sagal has had a long and tricky history with marriage. Prior to <a href=#>her current spouse, Kurt Sutter</a>, Sagal had been involved in three failed marriages. The actress was only 23 when she first tied the knot in 1977 with German bassist Freddie Beckmeier. However, the marriage only lasted 4 years. In 1986 Sagal married musician Fred Lombardo, yet the pair remained together for only 3 years. Following her second failed marriage Sagal tied the knot with drummer Jack White in 1993. The pair remained together for 7 years during which her journey into motherhood began as she birthed her eldest daughter and son. Her youngest daughter’s father, however, is her current husband and Sons Of Anarchy creator, Kurt Sutter.</p><h2 id=her-youngest-was-born-through-a-surrogate><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Her Youngest Was Born Through A Surrogate</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whilst she had given birth to her two elder children back in 1994 and 1996, Sagal decided that for her youngest daughter, Esme Lousie Sutter, she would employ the aid of a surrogate. In an interview with People magazine back in 2007, only one month after her daughter had been born, Sagal opened up about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">decision behind the surrogacy.</a></p><p>She stated, “I’d had some medical issues after the birth of my other two children, so I was unable to carry a child, so we were always looking at alternative approaches.”</p><h2 id=her-son-is-a-younger-version-of-her><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Her Son Is A Younger Version Of Her</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In March 1996, Sagal gave birth to her first and only son, Jackson James White. Having grown up under his actress mother and drummer father’s influence, it is fair to say that Sagal’s son has developed a certain sense of creative flair. However, that’s not the only thing that her son takes from his mother. In fact, it seems as though the pair share the same face! 25 years later and White is the spitting image of his mother. He also seems to share his mother’s particular sense of humor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as seen in an interview with KTLA 5 </a>back in October 2019.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which 'Sons Of Anarchy' Character Met The Worst End?</a></span></p><h2 id=he-even-shares-a-passion-for-acting><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Even Shares A Passion For Acting</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As previously mentioned, it is common that children of such talented artists develop a keen interest in the creative arts themselves. And White is no exception. Taking after his mother in the career path he chose to explore, he began acting back in 2017 when he landed a role as Ash Baker in Alex Israel's film SPF-18. Following this, White found his stride in television acting as he was cast in several recurring roles for multiple television series such as The Middle, SEAL Team, and Mrs. Fletcher. White returned to the world of film in 2021 when he portrayed the role of Charlie Porter in the film The Space Between.</p><h2 id=her-eldest-is-a-perfect-mix-of-her-parents><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Her Eldest Is A Perfect Mix Of Her Parents</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sagal’s firstborn and eldest is her daughter Sarah Grace White. She was born in August 1994 which marked the very beginning of Sagal’s journey into motherhood. Unlike her brother, throughout her younger years, White’s features resembled her father’s to an uncanny degree. However, now a fully grown young adult at 27, White seems to have developed into a younger version of her mother.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Son of Anarchy' Actor Katey Sagal Receives Support From Fans After Being Hit By A Car</a></span></p><h2 id=she-is-creative-and-endearing-like-her-mama><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Is Creative And Endearing Like Her Mama</span></h2><p>One thing Sagal's eldest does have in common with her younger brother, however, is the pursual of a creative career. With a few acting credits to her name such as her roles in NCIS, The Bastard Executioner, and even Rebel beside her mother, it’s clear that the young actress has inherited her mother’s creative streak. This is perhaps also best reflected in White’s public Instagram page in which she has shared several pictures and videos of past projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-youngest-lives-a-more-private-life><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Her Youngest Lives A More Private Life</span></h2><p>At only 14 years old, her youngest daughter, Esme Lousie Sutter, lives her life away from the spotlight. An occasional Instagram post from either Sagal or Sutter is the closest thing to exposure that the teenager gets as very little is known about her. However, due to the intensity and hardships that may come from living a life under the public eye, it’s easy to see why her parents would want to keep her away from the spotlight.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>These Baby Names Got Celebrities Roasted Mercilessly</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSmecqnprBlkZe8tsCMpJitnaliwKKzwKVkbGWTnbatsNGepWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-we-know-about-katey-sagal-3-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-we-know-about-katey-sagal-3-children.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-we-know-about-katey-sagal-3-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-we-know-about-katey-sagal-3-children.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-we-know-about-katey-sagal-3-children.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-we-know-about-katey-sagal-3-children.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./where-is-mark-owens-now-delia-owens-husband-age-and-net-worth-is-he-still-alive-259822-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./where-is-mark-owens-now-delia-owens-husband-age-and-net-worth-is-he-still-alive-259822-html.html>Where Is Mark Owens Now?
