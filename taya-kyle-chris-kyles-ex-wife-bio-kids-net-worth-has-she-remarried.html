Her father’s name is Kent Studebaker while her mother’s name is Kim.&nbsp;She also has a sister named Ashley Brittell, née Studebaker.&nbsp;Her father, Kent, is a public office holder and mayor of Lake Oswego, a city in the state of Oregon.&nbsp;Taya Kyle grew up in different parts of Portland, including Gladstone and Lake Oswego.&nbsp;While there are no specific details about her education, there is no doubt that she is well educated.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=husband-and-children></span><strong><span>husband and children</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Taya Kyle was married to former Navy Seal Chris Kyle, who was born in Odessa, Texas on&nbsp;</span><span>th</span><span>&nbsp;April 1974. He was educated at Midlothian High School and after graduating worked as a ranch hand for his father.&nbsp;He was also a professional bull rider but retired after an arm injury.&nbsp;Chris Kyle joined the military in 1999 and qualified as a member of the Elite Navy Seal.&nbsp;He spent ten years in the military during which he completed four tours of Iraq.&nbsp;During that time, he racked up as many as 150 kills, making him the deadliest sniper in American history.&nbsp;Chris Kyle retired from the Navy in 2009 and received various medals for his service.</span></p><p><span>Taya Kyle first met her husband in San Diegobar in 2001. They liked each other and began a relationship.&nbsp;The couple in love wasted no time in 2002, getting married the next year.&nbsp;Their marriage produced two children – a son named Colton and a daughter named McKenna.&nbsp;It must be noted that the couple’s marriage spanned the duration of Chris’ tour of duty in Iraq.&nbsp;The fact that he wasn’t at war put a lot of pressure on Kyle and the kids.&nbsp;She always feared for his safety and became concerned when there were military casualties in Iraq.&nbsp;Chris himself valued his family, but wanted to serve his country.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-kyles-death></span><strong><span>Chris Kyle’s death</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Taya Kyle’s husband Chris left the Navy in 2009 but kept busy by setting up a private military training company.&nbsp;He also supported many charitable programs, particularly for disabled veterans.&nbsp;In addition, Chris Kyle wrote a bestseller about his life story.&nbsp;The book is titled American Sniper and describes his personal and military service.&nbsp;The book was a national bestseller and spurned the 2014 film – American Sniper.&nbsp;The film was directed by Harrison Ford and starred Sienna Miller as Taya Kyle.&nbsp;Bradley Cooper, on the other hand, portrayed Chris.</span></p><span>The film was a commercial and critical hit, grossing more than $500 million on a budget of $58 million.&nbsp;It also received six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture.&nbsp;Chris Kyle sadly lost his life on the 2nd&nbsp;</span><span>of</span><span>&nbsp;February 2013. He was shot and killed by a Marine Corps veteran named Eddie Routh.&nbsp;He had been helping Routh who was suffering from PSTD.&nbsp;His death devastated his community and family.&nbsp;He was born on February 12th ,&nbsp;</span><span>2013</span><span>&nbsp;and received a hero’s funeral.&nbsp;Routh was later sentenced to life in prison without parole.</span><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wealth-income-and-earnings></span><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Taya Kyle has an estimated net worth of $3.5 million.&nbsp;Since the death of her husband, Kyle has been an author and activist.&nbsp;She wrote her own autobiography entitled American Wife: A Memoir of Love, Service, Faith and Renewal.&nbsp;She is also an advocate for issues affecting war veterans and their families.&nbsp;She believes that the government should provide them with better job opportunities and the health services they need.&nbsp;Her passion for the cause obviously stems from her personal experience.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-she-remarry></span><strong><span>Did she remarry?</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Taya Kyle has not married since the death of her husband.&nbsp;While he lived and served in Iraq, her late husband believed he might not survive the war.&nbsp;He therefore urged her to find love again if anything should happen to him.&nbsp;Despite these admonitions, Kyle still refuses to return to the dating pool.&nbsp;According to her, this is because she still loves her husband and still feels married to him.&nbsp;However, she has revealed that if she is to love again, it will happen.&nbsp;However, if it isn’t meant to be, she’ll still be fine with that.&nbsp;Her main focus now is raising her children.</span></p><p class=postsid
