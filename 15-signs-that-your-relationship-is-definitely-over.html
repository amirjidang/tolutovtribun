However, there is one aspect of relationships that everyone and their mother dreads and that is breakups.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Breakups are awkward, uncomfortable, painful, long, irritating, tedious and the list goes on. Breaking up with someone&nbsp;is one of the hardest things you do throughout your relationship journey, especially when the person you are dumping is a good person. On the other hand, getting broken up with is one of the worst feelings you can experience, especially if you did not see it coming.</p><p>Regardless of whether&nbsp;you are doing the dumping or getting dumped, there is nothing enjoyable about breakups and if you do find something enjoyable about it then we are sorry to say it but there is something wrong with you. No one likes hurting someone's feelings and at the same time, no one likes having their feelings hurt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is what inspired us at TheRichest to write an article, outlining fifteen of the most common signs that your relationship is over. The following is a list of fifteen things that will occur when your relationship has reached the breakup phase. The breakup phase is what happens when the relationship is expiring, but neither you nor your partner fully realize what is going on just yet. We hope this article helps and gives you some breakup insight, enjoy!</p><h2 id=15-it-feels-forced><strong>15. It&nbsp;Feels Forced&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Via bigstockphoto.com</p><p>This is one of the first and most common things that occur when you and your partner begin to enter the breakup phase. Relationships take effort, yes, but if simple things that you should love doing with your significant other become somewhat of a task, instead of a pleasure, then you need to start reconsidering things. When you need to force anything in life, chances are it is going to end badly, especially if it is a relationship.</p><p>Being with someone you love and being with the right person are two different things. Yes, sometimes there is still love there, but the relationship reaches its course. There is nothing wrong with this and this does not make either of you a bad person it is just part of growing up and growing apart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-you-re-no-longer-intimate><strong>14. You're No Longer Intimate</strong></h2><p>Via bigstockphoto.com</p><p>Sex may not be everything in a relationship but it is a really important part of it all. Physical intimacy is what separates friends and lovers. It is a connection that is necessary in order to keep a relationship alive.</p><p>If you find your sex life dying down to pretty much nothing, that is a red flag in your relationship. This is something that is not a determining factor and unlike a lot of things on this list, you can actually fix this. If you want to save your relationship try and spice things up a little bit. Relationships can become routine and sometimes you need to show your partner that the two of you still have new things to experience together, even in the bedroom.</p><h2 id=13-you-have-feelings-for-someone-else><strong>13. You&nbsp;Have Feelings For Someone Else</strong></h2><p>Via bigstockphoto.com</p><p>This is a bad situation to be in. Just because you are in a relationship and you start to feel for someone else does not mean you are a bad person. Cheating is one thing, but feeling something for another person and realizing that you should call it quits BEFORE you cheat is far preferred.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although this person always looks like the “bad guy”, the reality is that love is extremely complicated and sometimes you are unable to control who you fall for. Too many people are scared to hurt someone's feelings that they end up hurting them even more with their dishonesty. At the end of the day, if you have feelings for someone else while you are in a relationship you should end it as soon as possible.</p><h2 id=12-you-are-not-communicating><strong>12. You Are Not Communicating</strong></h2><p>Via bigstockphoto.com</p><p>Communication is one of the most important things in a relationship and if you no longer have that we are sorry to tell you that your relationship is doomed. We at TheRichest are not the first people to state that communicating is a key to a healthy relationship. If you want to spend the rest of your life with someone you need to know that you can communicate through the rough parts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Life gets extremely bumpy and having a solid partner by your side can make the journey a little more enjoyable. In order to do so, the two of you must be able to talk about anything and everything, from how your day was to how you are feeling. This is why we believe that if there is no longer any communication between you and your partner your relationships expiration date may come quicker than expected.</p><h2 id=11-you-re-always-fighting><strong>11. You're Always Fighting</strong></h2><p>Via bigstockphoto.com</p><p>Fighting is part of any relationships. Fights are not always a bad thing because fighting is still in a sense, a form of communicating. However, when the fighting becomes a daily routine, you should start reconsidering your relationship. Yes, you can work on this if you are both willing to do so, but most of the time it is symbolic of the beginning of the end.</p><p>A lot of the time, people fight because they are unhappy, which is a big sign that the relationship is not going well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Constant arguments are not only detrimental to the relationship they can also be detrimental to each individual. Fights can get nasty and a lot of the time things that are said in anger are not true reflections of feelings. Instead of pushing the fighting until your relationship reaches a place of no return and you hate each other, try to end the relationship before there is irreversible damage done.</p><h2 id=10-there-is-no-trust><strong>10. There&nbsp;Is No Trust</strong></h2><p>Via bigstockphoto.com</p><p>Trust is a key ingredient to not only having a good relationship but having a healthy and long lasting one. If you do not trust the person you are with, you simply should no longer be with them, plain and simple.</p><p>Relationships are not supposed to drive you crazy, they are not supposed to stress you out or leave you wondering where your partner is and who he is with? And if you don't have trust, that's exactly what you are going to be doing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A lot of people have been hurt in the past and have had their trust broken and that problem follows them to all their other relationships until they face their demons and deal with it. Do not be the reason someone has trust issues, if you want to cheat, just breakup.</p><h2 id=9-there-s-no-forgiveness><strong>9. There's No Forgiveness</strong></h2><p>Via bigstockphoto.com</p><p>Forgiveness is something that not many realize the importance of when it comes to relationships. Let's make one thing clear, forgiveness does not mean letting your partner walk all over you. However, what forgiveness portrays is letting things go. If you are in a relationship and everything from the past is being held over your head of you are doing that to your partner, we hate to break it to you but you guys should not be together.</p><p>Forgiveness is a powerful thing in general and by forgiving someone you let go of whatever pain they had caused you. If you are unable to do that with the person you are dating then that person should no longer be in your life. If you can't forgive, call it quits!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-you-do-not-have-fun-anymore><strong>8. You Do Not Have Fun Anymore</strong></h2><p>Via bigstockphoto.com</p><p>This is something that is so common to so many couples. When you get into a relationship, everything is new, exciting and of course, fun. No matter what the two of you do together, it becomes an adventure which is usually why the two of you fall in love. Now, fast forward a couple months or a couple years and that fun the two of you once had is no longer there, ever. Yes, you have the bliss memories of what it used to be, but shouldn't you be with the person that makes you have fun forever?</p><p>Usually, this is a very telling sign that the relationship is headed towards a breakup, however, in the end, it is for the best. We at TheRichest believe that there are certain things in life you should not settle with and relationships are one of them. Keep looking for a lifetime partner in crime, they are out there!</p><h2 id=7-you-do-not-see-a-future-with-them><strong>7. You&nbsp;Do Not See a Future With Them</strong></h2><p>Via bigstockphoto.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The only reason anyone should be in a long-term relationship is if they see a future with a person and if they do not, there is no reason to be dating them anymore. Envisioning a future with your partner is always an exciting thing. You dream about what your house would look like and how many kids you would have.</p><p>However, if you get to a point that when you envision your future, you do not see the person you are dating in the picture, chances are the relationship is close to ending.</p><p>This is a very common reason why people end their relationship. It has nothing to do with the person, there is nothing that could have been done differently, they just no longer fit into your future the way they used to.</p><h2 id=6-everything-they-do-irritates-you><strong>6. Everything&nbsp;They Do Irritates You</strong></h2><p>Via bigstockphoto.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This has happened to everyone at the end of a relationship. It is like everything they say and do bother you. This creates a lot of friction in the relationship because one person is always irritated and the other is always getting snapped at, and may not understand why. This becomes even worse if you two are living together and don't get that space you need to cool down.A lot of the time, this is the phase that happens right before people start fighting a lot. So, before you get to a place of no return, end the relationship, while you still respect each other. This is the relationships way of telling you that the curtains are closing soon and that it is time for this play to end.</p><p>A lot of the time, this is the phase that happens right before people start fighting a lot.

You&nbsp;No Longer Do Things To Make Them Happy</strong></h2><p>Via bigstockphoto.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Relationships are about being with someone that makes you happy. Well, if that person is no longer doing that, there is no real reason to stay with them. Finding a life partner can be difficult but the key is finding someone that can make you smile until you are old and gray.</p><p>Happiness is something that can't be bought, it can't be taught, it just is the most incredible feeling that everyone searches for. If the person you are dating no longer makes you happy or vice versa, then you owe it to yourself to no longer be with that person.</p><p>Happiness is worth more than all the money in the world and without it, you may find yourself never feeling complete as a person.</p><h2 id=4-you-have-no-attraction-to-them-anymore><strong>4. You&nbsp;Have No Attraction To Them Anymore</strong></h2><p>Via bigstockphoto.com</p><p>This is rare, but when a relationship is pushed too far from its expiration date this may be one of the reasons it ends. Every relationship starts with attraction, however, attraction can either grow in time or diminish. When you find yourself in a relationship where you are no longer attracted to your partner and no longer have a desire to be intimate with them, then that is a big problem. As we previously stated, yes, it is uncommon but it is not as uncommon as you think.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This occurs when you try and push something that is no longer there and you end up resenting the other person, thus making them less attractive in your eyes. All this to say, if you are not attracted to your partner, you should not be with them.</p><h2 id=3-you-post-selfies-and-not-photos-of-you-both><strong>3. You Post Selfies and Not Photos Of You Both</strong></h2><p>Via bigstockphoto.com</p><p>This is something that is very telling. When someone is in a relationship and they are happy, you often find them posting pictures together. Don't get it twisted, there are some of the best couples who rarely post on social media, however, in general, couples love posting pictures with their partner. After all, who wouldn't want to see how happy you are?</p><p>If you start to notice that your partner, who used to post a lot of pictures with you has suddenly been focusing more on their solo shoots, you should reconsider your relationship. Chances are your boo is not feeling it as much as they used to and although it may hurt, no one wants to be with someone who does not want to be with them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-you-don-t-answer-texts-calls><strong>2. You Don't&nbsp;Answer Texts/Calls</strong></h2><p>Via bigstockphoto.com</p><p>If you or your partner begin dodging calls and texts, chances are the end is near. We at TheRichest do not believe that your relationship should be in communication 24/7 but we do believe that you should not be ignoring their calls. If you start noticing that texts are going unanswered as well as calls, there is a big chance that the person you are trying to call is slowly checking out of the relationship.</p><p>A lot of the times, when people are unhappy with a significant other they do not know how to act around them, or what to say, which is why they start avoiding you. If you find yourself not answering calls, then you should ask yourself, why you are still with this person if you barely have a desire to speak to them.</p><h2 id=1-you-are-not-in-love-with-them><strong>1. You&nbsp;Are Not In Love With Them</strong></h2><p>Via bigstockphoto.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Loving someone and being in love with someone are two different things. If you are in a relationship where you find yourself no longer being in love with the person, that is not a relationship you should be in. This is something that is very common, however, not many people feel comfortable talking about it.</p><p>You can love someone for who they are and what they have been to you but that does not mean that you need to stay in a relationship with them.</p><p>We at TheRichest know that it is very painful to hurt someone that you love and respect, however, staying with them out of pity is not something that should be done either. If you are no longer in love with someone, the best thing to do is to sadly, call it quits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnXqttcWeZmptXai2qLrSZquhmaRixrDB0WapnqSRqbawutKhoKllmah6pbHFoqWirJWhxm671Z6paA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-signs-that-your-relationship-is-definitely-over.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f15-signs-that-your-relationship-is-definitely-over.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f15-signs-that-your-relationship-is-definitely-over.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f15-signs-that-your-relationship-is-definitely-over.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-signs-that-your-relationship-is-definitely-over.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-signs-that-your-relationship-is-definitely-over.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./20-rich-nba-stars-who-cant-afford-a-private-jet-like-michael-jordan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./20-rich-nba-stars-who-cant-afford-a-private-jet-like-michael-jordan.html>20 Rich NBA Stars Who Can't Afford A Private Jet Like Michael Jordan</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-friends-stars-who-regret-their-time-on-the-show-10-who-were-sweethearts.html>10 Friends Stars Who Regret Their Time On The Show (10 Who Were Sweethearts)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-friends-stars-who-regret-their-time-on-the-show-10-who-were-sweethearts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
