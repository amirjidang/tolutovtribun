Love was in the air for Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner...even Russel Brand and Katy Perry were #couplegoals - but nobody embodied true love back then like Heidi Klum and Seal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who would've guessed that a German supermodel and British-born soul singer would hit it off so hard? Within a matter of months, this pair’s chance meeting in Manhattan had turned them into a married couple with a child together and a handful of luxury homes.</p><p>They missed no opportunity to tell the world about their love story, either. We kept hearing Heidi gush about her husband’s "beautiful face, great body, amazing heart, voice, and his ability to be a loving, caring person and father." That’s from a 2011 interview with InStyle where she claimed that their dynamic "just works. We are black and white, yin and yang."</p><p>All this romance halted to a stop with one fateful tweet that shook the world in 2012, revealing that this pairing wasn’t perfect after all. Read on to remember that moment and every other high and low in the saga of Heidi and Seal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-met-in-a-hotel-lobby><span class=item-num>25 </span><span>They Met In A Hotel Lobby</span></h2><p>Though they had technically attended the same events like 2003’s GQ Awards in London, The Daily Mail reports that it wasn’t until the pair bumped into each other in a hotel lobby in 2004 that they properly met. As Heidi explains: "I met him in a hotel lobby in New York City, and he came in just from the gym. I was sitting there and I was like, wow."</p><h2 id=the-attraction-was-instant-and-intense><span class=item-num>24 </span><span>The Attraction Was Instant – And Intense</span></h2><p>"I was physically, straightaway attracted to him," Heidi admitted. Seal also felt their connection right away. "I was taken aback when I met her," he told The Daily Mail. "I thought she was one of the most beautiful women I’d seen. I thought: Whoever goes out with that girl is one lucky guy!" Little did he know he would marry this girl seven (yes, seven!) times. More on that later.</p><h2 id=she-was-pregnant-when-they-started-dating><span class=item-num>23 </span><span>She Was Pregnant When They Started Dating</span></h2><p>Early on in their relationship, Heidi revealed to Seal that she was going t have an ex-partner (businessman Flavio Briatore)'s baby. "We hadn’t seen each other for about a month and a half, and I came to New York. This time when I saw her, she had this bump," Seal explained to Oprah. It didn't scare him away, though. He said in that moment, he knew he was in love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=seal-adopted-heidi-s-love-child><span class=item-num>22 </span><span>Seal Adopted Heidi’s Love Child</span></h2><p>After being married to Heidi for a few years, Seal decided to make his parental status to Heidi's eldest daughter official. He adopted Leni in 2009 and changed her last name to match that of the rest of her half-siblings. "I don’t want her to feel different because I know what that’s like," Seal explained to People at the time. "I don’t want that dynamic for my little girl."</p><h2 id=heidi-raised-her-style-game-for-seal><span class=item-num>21 </span><span>Heidi Raised Her Style Game For Seal</span></h2><p>She may have hosted Project Runway for years, but Heidi Klum wasn't always a master of fashion herself. "I’ve gotten more stylish since I’ve been with my husband," she admitted to In Style. "I was always making fun of him because he has so many leather coats, jackets and shoes. But he looks hot. I want to look good for him. So I kind of stepped it up a bit."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-dated-for-just-1-year-before-marrying><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>They Dated For Just 1 Year Before Marrying</span></h2><p>When you know, you know! Isn't that what the romantics say? Heidi and Seal had a relatively short period of being bf/gf before making it official. They started going out in 2004 and then married each other in 2005. We kind of get it. If you got your hands on a Victoria's Secret angel or dreamy soul singer, wouldn't you want to lock them down ASAP, too?</p><h2 id=he-proposed-in-an-igloo><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>He Proposed In An Igloo</span></h2><p>"I proposed on Dec. 23 at 14,000 feet in Whistler, B.C., in uncharted terrain on a glacier, in a natural snow cave, in an igloo built just for the moment," Seal told People. Heidi confirmed this spectacular engagement story to Marie Claire: "He had an igloo built there, and they’d brought up everything: a bed with sheets inside the igloo, rose petals everywhere, candles. Very, very romantic!" Aww.</p><h2 id=they-had-a-secret-wedding-in-mexico><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>They Had&nbsp;A Secret Wedding In Mexico</span></h2><p>According to Fame10, Seal and Heidi got married in a super private ceremony on the beach in Mexico in May 2005. There were reportedly only 40 guests present, no media allowed, and a cute cake featuring a tiny Heidi and Seal figurine on top. Heidi is also rumored to have worn an empire-waisted Vera Wang gown as she was pregnant with the couple's first child together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-renewed-their-vows-every-year><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>They Renewed Their Vows EVERY YEAR</span></h2><p>Every year of their marriage, Seal and Heidi renewed their vows in a wild, over the top, themed party. The year pictured here was 'white trash' themed according to Redbook magazine, while other ceremonies were retro-themed or (on the very last occasion) involved every guest wearing a wedding gown or groom's tux. "It’s about remembering this moment of love we gave to each other," Heidi told the magazine. Alright, girl.</p><h2 id=seal-wasn-t-into-heidi-s-vow-renewal-parties><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Seal Wasn’t Into Heidi’s Vow Renewal Parties</span></h2><p>Heidi Klum is famous for her themed parties. She goes all out with costumes, food, musical guests, and more. All this was a bit too high-key for Seal, especially when it came to their vow renewal parties. He told Andy Cohen they weren't his scene: "It kind of turned into a little bit of a circus, which I wasn’t terribly fond of because, by default, I’m quite a private person."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-didn-t-have-a-prenup><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>They Didn’t Have&nbsp;A Prenup</span></h2><p>According to TMZ, Heidi Klum and Seal got married without ever signing any kind of pre-nuptial agreement. This seems insane for celebs with that much individual earning power! How could anyone be so chill about merging their massive bank accounts? TMZ reports that eventually, the pair did settle on a 'postnup' which helped them divide their assets when the time came to go their separate ways.</p><h2 id=heidi-used-to-sing-badly-to-seal><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Heidi Used To Sing (Badly) To Seal</span></h2><p>In Heidi and Seal's shared home, there was as much music as you'd expect there to be with Seal as a Grammy-winning artist. It wasn't only him singing, though. "We sing all the time," Heidi told In Style. "He’s always rolling his eyeballs because I’m in the wrong key. But I know he’s laughing about it too. So I’m not a singer – who cares? Not everyone is Seal!"</p><h2 id=seal-considered-heidi-his-best-friend><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Seal Considered Heidi His ‘Best Friend’</span></h2><p>Seal told Oprah that he saw Heidi as "first my best friend, then my wife." He believed this strengthened their bond, explaining that "there are very few things that you really take for granted with your best friend. You never really want to let your best friend down. The fundamental thing that you have for your best friend is respect."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-had-2-sons-and-a-daughter-together><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>They Had 2 Sons And&nbsp;A Daughter Together</span></h2><p>Is there anything luckier than being born into a multi-millionaire model family? You know you've got genes that the world already thinks are gorgeous coming at you from both sides of the family tree! Heidi and Seal gave more first-class talent and beauty to the world by bringing Henry (born 2005), Johan (born 2006), and Lou (born 2009) into their little family. Now they're 15, 13, and 10 respectively.</p><h2 id=heidi-did-almost-all-the-parenting><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Heidi Did Almost All The Parenting</span></h2><p>It sucks doing all the parenting when you're in a partnership, but that was Heidi's experience being married to Seal. She let out her frustration in an interview with Life And Style Magazine, explaining that Seal's travel schedule and social engagements made her feel like she had to be "the mom and dad at the same time." This wasn't the only thing that broke their marriage down, though...</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Disick And 19 Other Celeb Dads Who Tried To Neglect Their Kids</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=seal-didn-t-have-great-communication-skills><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Seal Didn’t Have Great Communication Skills</span></h2><p>You might think Heidi and Seal's marriage had it all, but it turns out they struggled in the communication department. This came to light after Heidi met her current man (guitarist Tom Kaulitz) and revealed to People that she'd become "a much happier person" because "for the first time, I have a partner who I can discuss everything with." With Seal, she felt "on my own with everything." Yikes.</p><h2 id=the-kids-took-after-seal-more-than-heidi><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The Kids Took After Seal More Than Heidi</span></h2><p>In an interview with Elle Magazine, Heidi revealed that her children haven't inherited her elegant grace on the catwalk. "They hobble on their little heels for 20 steps from the car to the restaurant," she explained. Seal did pass along some of his talents, though. In that same interview, Heidi explained that little Henry has his father’s singing voice! We wonder if there are platinum hits in this kid's future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paparazzi-in-ibiza-spotted-trouble-in-paradise><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Paparazzi In Ibiza Spotted Trouble In Paradise</span></h2><p>In August 2011, paparazzi caught moments of tension between Heidi and Seal on their family vacation to Ibiza. While Heidi was watching the kids at all hours of the day and night, Seal was off partying at beachfront resorts with young and barely-dressed women.&nbsp;The Daily Mail reported that&nbsp;Seal hitting the club scene hard put a strain on their relationship that the pair never seemed to recover from.</p><h2 id=divorce-rumors-flew-when-seal-tweeted-the-end><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Divorce Rumors Flew When Seal Tweeted ‘The End’</span></h2><p>One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptic tweet</a> from Seal's account sent rumors flying in January 2012. Without any explanation, he said "The end." Fans figured he was referring to his seven-year-long marriage since there had been literal trouble in paradise a few weeks prior. What a move! The only thing more 2010s than announcing your split via a tweet is changing your relationship status on FB and waiting for people to notice. Groan.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Tweets That Just Shouldn’t Exist</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=seal-announced-their-separation-on-ellen><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Seal Announced Their Separation On Ellen</span></h2><p>On January 24, 2012, Seal went on The Ellen Show to clear the air about his relationship with Heidi. He explained they were separating because they "grew apart," but that he was going to keep wearing his wedding ring for a while to stay "connected" to Heidi. "She is the most wonderful woman in the world," he told Ellen, mournfully. "She has given me four incredible gifts, four beautiful children."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqGUnnqsuNSmZJqmlGLApq3LZmluZZakv6i7062cp2WWlrC1v4yamaitpGLBqbHIq2SrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheidi-klum-and-seal-25-forgotten-facts-about-their-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheidi-klum-and-seal-25-forgotten-facts-about-their-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheidi-klum-and-seal-25-forgotten-facts-about-their-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheidi-klum-and-seal-25-forgotten-facts-about-their-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheidi-klum-and-seal-25-forgotten-facts-about-their-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheidi-klum-and-seal-25-forgotten-facts-about-their-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./8-celebrities-who-didnt-want-to-kiss-their-co-star-and-8-who-couldnt-wait.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./8-celebrities-who-didnt-want-to-kiss-their-co-star-and-8-who-couldnt-wait.html>8 Celebrities Who Didn't Want To Kiss Their Co-Star (And 8 Who Couldn't Wait!)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./15-most-awful-af-red-carpet-looks-ever.html>16 Most Awful AF Red Carpet Looks Ever</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./15-most-awful-af-red-carpet-looks-ever.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
