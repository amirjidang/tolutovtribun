Since many of these models were known to upstage one another at fashion shows or compete for magazine covers and endorsement deals, it didn’t surprise people when they would hear about one model’s hate for another. Yet, the days of battling models seem to be coming to an end since celebrities are starting to realize how much more publicity they can get when they align themselves with other big names in the industry. Just like <a href=#>Taylor Swift’s</a> girl squad that just amplifies her own fame and prestige as a celebrity, models are starting to make their own teams to showcase just how beautiful they look when compared to others in the fashion industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Kendall Jenner</a> and <a href=#>Cara Delevingne</a> even came up with a nickname for their best friend status and have joined the first two letters of their first names to create&nbsp;CaKe. This dynamic duo has been seen on numerous red carpets together and has traveled all over the globe at various fashion shows. Yet, it’s not just their professional lives that have kept them in the spotlight since the two are often seen hanging out in their spare time. With both of them being thought of as two of the most successful and beautiful models in the industry, it’s actually quite refreshing to see that they aren’t at each other’s throats. Instead, they seem super close and their friendship has been documented in recent years through various photos. Check out our list of the 15 extremely close photos of Kendall Jenner and Cara Delevingne and see just how chummy these two beauties have become.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=backstage-fun-at-the-2014-british-fashion-awards><strong>Backstage Fun At the 2014 British Fashion Awards</strong></h2><p>Cara Delevingne and Kendall Jenner were photographed backstage at the 2014 British Fashion Awards and some of their playful antics beat out their most sophisticated poses. Delevingne wound up taking home the award for Model of the Year, even though she had previously won the award in 2012. While both of them have been known to be extremely affectionate towards one another, this instance was a bit more grabby. Delevingne can be seen grabbing Jenner from behind and it looks like she got to second base on a few of their poses. It was obviously super playful and Jenner seemed to be making the most of it, as she smiled and posed with her prestigious model bestie. It was difficult to name which model had the sexiest ensemble that night since Delevingne’s ensemble featured a super high slit and Jenner wore a skintight pants look. Yet, since Delevingne took home the award, it seems like she probably won.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-few-licks-between-friends><strong>A Few Licks Between Friends</strong></h2><p>In an effort to drum up some extra publicity for Cake, Cara Delevingne took to Instagram and uploaded a photo of her and Kendall Jenner in what appeared to be a topless or naked photo of them. Delevingne can be seen wearing a gaudy gold chain and Jenner has a pair of bright blue Beats headphones. Delevingne has her tongue on Jenner’s shoulder, with her eyes looking straight up towards her. Jenner has the tip of her tongue on the forehead of Delevingne. When Delevingne posted the picture to her Instagram page, she put the caption, “#CaKe.” It caused a frenzy amongst fans, with everyone a little confused on the meaning behind the photo. Some speculated that it was a prelude to some sort of collaborative project and others just thought that it was plain weird.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=swinging-together><strong>Swinging Together</strong></h2><p>Hollywood events seem to be in a constant struggle to try and outdo one another and the same goes for birthday parties. From partying on a yacht to chartering a private plane, it seems like every celebrity wants to have their event be the best that could ever be. When Olivier Rousteing started compiling his guest list for his birthday bash, the fact that he had so many beautiful women in attendance may have been part of the reason why there was an outdoor swing bench set out in the grass. Kendall and Kylie Jenner were photographed on the swing and Cara Delevingne was photographed getting in on the fun. There wasn’t exactly enough room for all three girls to sit on the swing but that didn’t stop Delevingne from practically straddling Kendall and getting her swing on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=snuggling-in-bed><strong>Snuggling In Bed</strong></h2><p>Models are known for sharing a living situation together, especially if they are both working for the same agency or traveling to the same fashion shows. It’s interesting to think that there are apartment buildings all over the globe that have some of the most beautiful women in the world living together. This simple fact was even highlighted on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills when <a href=#>Yolanda Foster’s</a> daughter, Gigi Hadid, moved out of her mother’s home and began living with some of her fellow models in the industry. With models always having to jet set around the world, it isn’t exactly feasible for them to have a permanent house that needs maintaining while they’re gone. Men have often fantasized what it would be like to have a peek into what that sort of living situation would be like and they were treated with a great mental image when Cara Delevingne posted a snap to Instagram in October of 2015. Wearing matching pajamas and staring into each other’s eyes, this cuddled up photo of Delevingne and Kendall Jenner caused many imaginations to start roaming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mario-and-luigi-costumes><strong>Mario And Luigi Costumes</strong></h2><p>It isn’t out of the norm for celebrities to go all out when it comes to dressing up in costumes. <a href=#>Heidi Klum</a> has become infamous for her childlike enthusiasm over dressing up for Halloween and celebrities are always looking for excuses to throw on a costume. While celebrity couple’s costumes always turn out pretty great, Cara Delevingne and Kendall Jenner proved that couple’s costumes include best buds as well. Dressed as the iconic video game characters, Mario and Luigi, Jenner even managed to make a mustache look sexy. Neither of the costumes were overly revealing but the jumpsuit style sure did hug their curves nicely. Since they came as part of a costume duo, they spent the rest of the evening being photographed together. Delevingne made sure to post their look to Instagram and people couldn’t get enough of how cute the two looked together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=happy-to-see-you-embrace><strong>Happy To See You Embrace</strong></h2><p>Although Cara Delevingne and Kendall Jenner often spend a lot of time together when they’re booked to the same fashion shows or working on collaborative projects, their schedules aren’t always perfectly aligned. The two models have been constantly busy in recent years and they don’t exactly have the luxury of a super relaxed schedule. When they greeted each other at the March 2015 <a href=#>Karl Lagerfeld</a> NYC Party, bystanders could see just how happy they were to see one another. They ran into each other’s arms and the whole encounter was caught on camera. Delevingne can be seen with her eyes closed while enjoying their embrace and Jenner seems to be practically straddling her in their embrace. While this isn’t the first time Jenner has been photographed straddling Delevingne, seeing it in a much less staged setting seemed a bit more genuine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=opposites-attract><strong>Opposites Attract</strong></h2><p>The world has been fascinated with the huge similarities in the facial features of Cara Delevingne and Kendall Jenner. They practically have the same turned-up button nose and medium-sized lips and even their facial structure seems to mirror one another. Yet, Jenner is known for her signature brown locks and Delevingne has a much lighter shade that makes it a perfect combination to highlight two very different styles of beauty. This was made even more evident when the pair were featured in the same fashion show in Salzburg. Wearing ultra frilly Victorian-style dresses, Jenner stuck with the dark theme while Delevingne had a snow white frock. The two looked like polar opposites of one another but they played it up by remaining close and being photographed locked in a front-to-back embrace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=attached-at-the-shoulder><strong>Attached At The Shoulder</strong></h2><p>The world has become accustomed to seeing high fashion models don ensembles that wouldn’t exactly look normal if worn to the local grocery store. From torn rags to couture see-through looks, it isn’t out of the ordinary to see either Cara Delevingne or Kendall Jenner in some off-the-wall outfit while strutting their stuff down the catwalk. Yet, this photo proves that not all of their looks come straight off the runway. The two were spotted together in Salzburg at the Chanel Martier d’Art Collection in 2014. Jenner dressed all in black and Delevingne seemed to be wearing a onesie outfit, complete with floppy ears attached to the hood. The two were photographed a number of times and later, Jenner swapped out her tan jacket for a black fur vest and Delevingne threw on a leather jacket over her onesie. Yet, this particular photo was the favorite for the entire event because of their super close pose and playful nature at being attached at the shoulder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-same-face><strong>The Same Face</strong></h2><p>There have been a number of criticisms over plastic surgery because there are some that believe that it is causing many celebrities to look alike. With so many stars using the same plastic surgeons, it seems like everyone has the same straight line nose job and perfectly perky breasts. While <a href=#>J. Lo</a> used to be the only celebrity known for her derriere, the big butt craze has caused a number of celebs to miraculously acquire the same bubble butt look. Some of the most infamous have been members of the Kardashian/Jenner clan and even Kylie has undergone a transformation that has caused her to look much more like Kim than ever before. Kendall has been hailed for her natural good looks and her resistance to plastic surgery to try and amplify her physical characteristics. Yet, that doesn’t mean she is truly unique in her appearance. In this blended photo of Jenner and Cara Delevingne, people were shocked at how similar these two models looked. It doesn’t get much closer than having someone look pretty much like your exact copy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sharing-food><strong>Sharing Food</strong></h2><p>There is an old adage that models don’t ever really eat, which is pretty believable when considering how super thin both Kendall Jenner and Cara Delevingne are in regard to their body type. Their size zero slim figure is practically mandatory in the modeling world and there have been some horrible stories that have come from the fashion industry regarding models that starve themselves or go to unhealthy lengths to maintain their physique. Yet, Kendall Jenner has never seemed to have a problem with her size since she’s maintained her slim figure as the world watched her grow up on Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Proving that not all models choose to starve themselves, Delevingne posted a photo of her and Jenner eating off of the same plate to her Instagram page. Without using utensils, the photo shows just how close the two are when they can eat off of the same plate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=love-magazine-carrying-shots><strong>Love Magazine Carrying Shots</strong></h2><p>When Cara Delevingne and Kendall Jenner were asked to pose for LOVE magazine, it was inevitable that they would try and make the shoot as provocative as possible. These two models have been taking the fashion industry by storm and pairing them up together opened up a world of possibilities. They played on the opposite tones in their hair and coordinated their leotard-like ensembles, which really showed off their legs. In both of these shots, it’s Delevingne that is carrying Jenner. Delevingne looks strong and sexy, while Jenner looks flawless with her legs wrapped around the blonde beauty. In one of the more playful shots, Delevingne looks to be trying to prop her up and used her backside as a way to scoot her up higher. Seeing Delevingne with her hand planted firmly on Jenner’s derriere was one of the sexiest shots these two models have ever posed for together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-friendly-little-kiss><strong>A Friendly Little Kiss</strong></h2><p>When Cara Delevingne and Kendall Jenner were asked to pose for LOVE magazine, there were a plethora of options available in regard to their cover shot. Yet, the photo that was chosen wasn’t a high glamor shot filled with mass airbrushing and staging. While they were both dressed impeccably and positively glowing in their beauty, the rest of the photo looked like something that the two of them would post to their social media sites. Despite its lackluster execution, it more than made up for it with its content. Delevingne can be seen planting a kiss on Jenner and the look on her face is priceless. She looks absolutely indulgent in the experience and has her eyes closed in a full-on moment of basking in Delevingne’s favor. While it isn’t out of the norm for friends to plant a friendly kiss on one another, this particular pose isn’t something that usually passes between friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lounging-and-holding-hands><strong>Lounging And Holding Hands</strong></h2><p>There are some celebrity friendships that many accuse of being faked for the sake of the public. Just like how <a href=#>Beyonce</a> is seen to be extremely friendly with <a href=#>Adele</a> anytime the two are photographed together at an award show but then the two are never seen hanging out in their regular lives, it can be pretty easy to point out which celebrity friendships are genuine. This particular photo of Cara Delevingne and Kendall Jenner is a perfect example of how their friendship isn’t only based on how they can look at a red carpet event. When the two were both in the French Riviera for the 2015 Cannes, they didn’t hesitate to take some time away from all of the festivities to lounge by the pool and connect. They can be seen reaching out to one another and the result is a beautiful photo that perfectly shows just how happy they were to be in the same place at the same time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matching-bff-tops><strong>Matching BFF Tops</strong></h2><p>While Taylor Swift may have her girl squad, Cara Delevingne and Kendall Jenner have their own dynamic duo and it is exclusive to only two people. Combining both of their names, CaKe, is more than just a pet name between friends. It has become a brand in and of itself and has its own following that amplifies both of their status as a celebrity. In January of 2016, the two were photographed with <a href=#>Joe Jonas</a> wearing matching “CaKe tour” shirts. At the time, Jonas had released the “Cake By The Ocean” single with his band, DNCE. Although the name of the song was supposedly based loosely off of a misinterpretation of sex on the beach, people couldn’t help but think that it might have something to do with the CaKe model besties, Delevingne and Jenner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=masquerade-face-off><strong>Masquerade Face-Off</strong></h2><p>Being two of the top models in the fashion industry, one of the many perks that go with the territory are the amazing A-list invites they receive from prestigious events all over the world. The two were guests at Cavalli’s Masquerade Ball in London and people were absolutely stunned at how gorgeous they both looked. The masks were worn over the eyes in an elaborate lace motif with rhinestone crystals drawing further accent to their eyes. Jenner paired it up with a bright red lip but Delevingne had a more subtle look to go with her gold-toned mask. The pair also posed in a face-to-face position and posted it to social media. Standing close enough to press up against one another, this was a super sexy look for both of them. Rather than looking like a costume, the masks created even more of an allure to both of these beautiful celebs.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong><a href=#>The Daily Mirror</a>, <a href=#>Pop Crush</a>, <a href=#>Hollywood Life</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2axbW%2BxKacpbFdmLmwv8Rmp6GnpKTAbrvFZqKeppSWua15yZ6lp52iYq6vsIycmKuZXZmyrbHVoqWgppVk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-extremely-close-photos-of-kendall-jenner-and-cara-delevingne.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f15-extremely-close-photos-of-kendall-jenner-and-cara-delevingne.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f15-extremely-close-photos-of-kendall-jenner-and-cara-delevingne.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f15-extremely-close-photos-of-kendall-jenner-and-cara-delevingne.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-extremely-close-photos-of-kendall-jenner-and-cara-delevingne.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-extremely-close-photos-of-kendall-jenner-and-cara-delevingne.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./15-pics-that-show-why-fans-will-always-love-jessica-biel.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./15-pics-that-show-why-fans-will-always-love-jessica-biel.html>15 Pics That Show Why Fans Will Always Love Jessica Biel</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-times-howard-stern-shocked-the-world.html>10 Times Howard Stern Shocked The World</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-times-howard-stern-shocked-the-world.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
