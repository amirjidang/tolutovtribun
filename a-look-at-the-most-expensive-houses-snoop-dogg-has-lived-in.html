He developed a love for music while playing the piano and singing in the church choir and worked odd jobs as a teenager. <a href=#>Using the stage name Snoop Dogg</a>, he released a mixtape <i>Hold On</i> that landed with Dr. Dre, signed him up with his record label Aftermath Entertainment and released his debut album, <i>Doggystyle</i>, which topped the Billboard charts. <a href=#>Snoop Dogg has amassed a whopping $150 million net worth</a> through his music, record label, and movie cameos. Along with purchasing cars and jewelry, the rapper has spent millions buying homes.</p><p>Snoop Dogg purchased several properties early in his career around California and renovated them with the changing time. As one of the biggest rappers in the world, his mansions are just as larger than life. Let’s look at the most expensive houses Snoop Dogg has lived in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=claremont-california-home>Claremont, California Home</h2><p>After being discovered by Dr. Dre in 1992, Snoop Dogg’s career took off, making him a chart-topping rapper. Two years later, he purchased his first big mansion, a Mediterranean-style home, for $660,000. His house was first featured in MTV <i>Cribs</i> in 2000 and went through a renovation in 2006. The home was 3,700 square feet in size. However, the rapper extended the area to 6,527 square feet to accommodate the other rooms better. Located atop a hill, at the far end of a cul-de-sac, the estate is a few miles east of Los Angeles.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Inside Dr. Dre's $40 Million Mega Mansion In Brentwood</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the home initially featured five bedrooms, but Snoop extended the house to accommodate eight bedrooms. The two-story home has dual Master Suites with attached walk-in closets. Other amenities in the home include marble fireplaces, a theater room, a pool with a pool house, a tennis court, and a recording studio. The home is structured with high ceilings, recessed lighting, crown moldings, and dual-pane windows. Additionally, the kitchen is a Chef’s dream with marble countertops and top-of-the-line steel appliances for use. After living in the home for a decade and renovating it, Snoop put the house on sale in 2007 and sold it for a profit, earning $2 million from the deal.</p><h2 id=diamond-bar-california-mansion>Diamond Bar, California Mansion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1998, <a href=#>Snoop Dogg decided to add another</a> great property to his name, a mansion in Diamond Bar, one of the most expensive cities in California. While the rapper is open about sharing details about himself, he has been relatively secretive about giving fans a glimpse inside his estate. Snoop purchased the home for a bargain price of $720,000, while the house is estimated to be worth $1.7 million today, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello Magazine</a>. The 2.8 acres of land has the primary residence on 4,000 square feet of living space.</p><p>The mansion houses four bedrooms and four bathrooms in County Estates, a gated community with top-rated security. Along with the basic amenities, his house also features a spa. Outdoors, his home is just as majestic. Snoop has a swimming pool, a pool house, a gazebo, and a basketball court. Palm trees and shrubbery shroud the large backyard of the traditional home to offer optimum privacy to Snoop and his family. Diamond Bar remains his primary residence as the rapper continues to live there and even gives small glimpses through his social media accounts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-church>The Church</h2><p>Located on the same street as his dream-like mansion in Diamond Bar, Snoop Dogg purchased a modest three-bedroom a few years after buying his home, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Things</a>. While it may seem odd that the rapper bought a house a few minutes from his primary residence, many were surprised when he transformed the mansion into a fully-functioning recording studio. Calling it his Church, Snoop spends most of his time working on music in the studio, and it remains a sacred place for him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His recording studio is a fortress with a massive parking lot where his classic cars reside. For a sports fan, there is ample space to play basketball and an indoor game room. As mentioned by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a>, the studio has a soundstage and three recording studios adorned with portraits and photographs of family and friends. Two recording rooms in the studio are called Mothership and Battleship, with the former housing the main workstation. <a href=#>Snoop has exclusively recorded some of his gospel albums</a> in the recording studio and continues using them to create new music.</p><p>Around February 2022, Snoop made another purchase of a duplex home a few miles away from the So-Fi Stadium in Los Angeles for $1.29 million. The property was constructed in 1948 and combined two houses to create a complex with four bedrooms and two bathrooms. Snoop Dogg has only sold one of his properties and continues to live in his Diamond Bar Mansion, which has increased in value over the last two decades.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>9 Silicon Valley Moguls Who Have Pledged To Donate Most Of Their Fortune</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello Magazine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Things</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Bmo6inm2KutXnToZxmpZ%2BowW6x16mcp6uZq7JutM6uqp6rXai7sLvPZpuon5ditaK%2FjKWgr52UYravew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-look-at-the-most-expensive-houses-snoop-dogg-has-lived-in.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fa-look-at-the-most-expensive-houses-snoop-dogg-has-lived-in.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fa-look-at-the-most-expensive-houses-snoop-dogg-has-lived-in.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fa-look-at-the-most-expensive-houses-snoop-dogg-has-lived-in.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-look-at-the-most-expensive-houses-snoop-dogg-has-lived-in.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-look-at-the-most-expensive-houses-snoop-dogg-has-lived-in.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-played-hawkman-in-black-adam-aldis-hodge.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-played-hawkman-in-black-adam-aldis-hodge.html>Aldis Hodge Has One Major Issue With Hawkman In Black Adam</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1299114-will-ospreay-karl-anderson-and-tanga-loa-pulled-from-njpw-super-juniors-final.html>Will Ospreay, Karl Anderson And Tanga Loa Pulled From NJPW Super Juniors Final</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1299114-will-ospreay-karl-anderson-and-tanga-loa-pulled-from-njpw-super-juniors-final.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
