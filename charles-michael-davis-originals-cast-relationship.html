For that reason, it makes perfect sense that networks often try to launch spin-offs from their most popular shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unsurprisingly, it often seems like the vast majority of spin-offs utterly fail. In fact, there are many examples of the networks <a href=#>canceling spin-offs before they even air an episode</a> because they have no faith in them at all.</p><p>Fortunately for everyone involved in The Originals, some people <a href=#>like it more than the show it spun off from</a>, The Vampire Diaries. Of course, that is a wonderful thing for Charles Michael Davis and his Originals co-stars since they were able to work together for years.</p><p>Since The Originals made Davis famous, he has regularly been interviewed by members of the press. During several of those discussions, Davis has had some interesting things to say about his Originals co-stars.</p><h2 id=charles-michael-davis-39-comments-about-becoming-his-originals-co-stars-boss>Charles Michael Davis' Comments About Becoming His Originals Co-Stars Boss</h2><p>Since there are millions of people who dream of becoming rich and famous actors someday, the amount of competition actors have to deal with is intense, to say the least. As a result, you'd probably think that actors who make it big would be content with that achievement alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What The Cast Of 'The Originals' Is Doing In 2021</a></span></p><p>As it turns out, a lot of people who rise to fame as actors got into the business in the first place because of their love for storytelling. For that reason, it has become increasingly common for <a href=#>famous actors to become directors</a> in recent years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/charles-michael-davis.jpg><p>After Charles Michael Davis learned that Paul Wesley directed an episode of The Vampire Diaries, he decided he wanted to follow suit. As a result, Davis wound up directing two episodes of The Originals which aired in the fourth and fifth seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When someone goes from being a co-worker to being the boss, that can often cause a lot of tension. With that in mind, it easily could have gone poorly when Davis became his co-worker's boss during the making of two episodes of The Originals.</p><p>When Davis talked to Entertainment Weekly in 2017, he talked about his experience directing his co-stars and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it sounds like everything went great</a>.</p><p>"It was great because they treated me like a director. They really trusted me. They looked to me in a way that was very open and receptive to direction. They cared for my opinion. They didn’t fight me at all or anything like that."</p><h2 id=is-charles-michael-davis-friends-with-any-of-his-originals-co-stars>Is Charles Michael Davis Friends With Any Of His Originals Co-Stars?</h2><p>Years before Charles Michael Davis started directing episodes of The Originals, he was an actor who was trying to be cast in the show. From the outside looking in, it is pretty easy to imagine how auditioning for a role that could make or break your career would be incredibly nerve-wracking.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Joseph Morgan Earn More On The Originals Or The Vampire Diaries?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, Charles Michael Davis was interviewed by Collider and the topic of how he landed his role in The Originals came up. As Davis revealed, The Vampire Diaries production manager reached out to him and asked the actor to audition for The Originals.</p><p>According to Davis, after initially not being sure if he wanted to audition for the role, he read the script and changed his mind. Then, things really came together when he auditioned and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he realized that a friend of his was involved</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/joseph-morgan.jpg><p>"Three days later, I got the audition and, as soon as I read the first few lines of the character’s entrance, I just knew. I called her back and I said, “I’ll see you soon!” And Joseph was playing Klaus, and we had played poker, years ago."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of Davis revealing his friendship with Joseph Morgan, it seems very clear that he became close with his other Originals co-stars. After all, there seemingly are endless clips of Davis appearing to have a wonderful time goofing around with his co-stars.</p><h2 id=why-charles-michael-davis-really-missed-his-co-stars>Why Charles Michael Davis Really Missed His Co-Stars</h2><p>In 2022, The Originals fans all over the world were extremely excited to see an episode from the fourth season of Legacies, another show in the Vampire Diaries franchise. The reason for the excitement is that several of The Originals' main stars appeared in the Legacies episode "Everything That Can Be Lost May Also Be Found".</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Vampire Diaries Star Steven R. McQueen Have A Relationship With His Famous Grandfather?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As exciting as it was for The Originals fans to see the show's stars bring their beloved characters to life again during that Legacies episode, reuniting had to be even better for the actors. Unfortunately, however, two of The Originals biggest stars couldn't be involved in the episode.</p><p>Around the time the Legacies episode that featured him aired, Charles Michael Davis was interviewed by Entertainment Weekly about the filming process. While Davis made it clear he was overjoyed to be back with most of his The Originals co-stars, he also stated that they all <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">missed having Joesph Morgan and Daniel Gillies there</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/daniel-gillies.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Davis, Morgan and Gillies had a huge effect on The Originals cast because of their "sense of humor". "We loved telling jokes and we loved just keeping it light. We definitely looked to them when we were on set, just to help keep things light."</p><p>Davis then went on to say that with Gillies and Morgan absent, his character Marcel was expected to take up the slack they left behind. "He brings a swagger and a coolness in a Lenny Kravitz kind of way. He brings the fun."</p><p>While Davis tried his best to entertain the way Morgan and Gillies would have, he still says that he missed his former Originals co-stars and so did everyone else involved. "Their presence was definitely missed."</p><p>Based on everything Davis has said about his Originals co-stars, it seems clear that he has a lot of love for the show's other main actors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoZmiobK0ecyimqGZlaF6pa3Voqpmp6KetKq6wKWqZpuRqMFuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcharles-michael-davis-originals-cast-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcharles-michael-davis-originals-cast-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcharles-michael-davis-originals-cast-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcharles-michael-davis-originals-cast-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcharles-michael-davis-originals-cast-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcharles-michael-davis-originals-cast-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tim-curry-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tim-curry-net-worth.html>Tim Curry Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-year-in-playmates-most-popular-months.html>The Year In Playmates: 2013's Most Popular Months</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-year-in-playmates-most-popular-months.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
