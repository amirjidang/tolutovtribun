She and Kim were instant besties and were constantly posing for selfies with one another and attending one another's major life events and celebrations. The ladies made regular appearances together and paparazzi cameras routinely snapped their joyful moments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For a very long time, it truly seemed that Larsa Pippen and<a href=#><strong> Kim Kardashian</strong></a> were inseparable. Fans were baffled when the ladies started airing their dirty laundry to the media, as there was no visible dragging or trolling online that would have suggested there was any sort of<a href=#> trouble within their friendship.</a> It suddenly became clear that something happened to <a href=#>shake up the bond they once shared </a>and whether or not they can repair <a href=#>the damage that has been done</a> remains unclear.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-and-larsa-pippen-started-off-as-39-besties-at-first-sight-39><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kim Kardashian And Larsa Pippen Started Off As 'Besties At First Sight'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was 2021 when the former star of The Real Housewives of Miami, Larsa Pippen, made an appearance on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Her guest appearance was an instant hit, and she started to be featured on the show quite regularly. It was clear from the beginning that she and Kim Kardashian shared an instant connection, and they became close friends almost immediately. The ladies began sharing time together off-screen, and their friendship developed organically.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘RHOM’: Larsa Pippen To Spill The Tea On Her Fallout With The Kardashians</a></span></p><h2 id=larsa-became-a-permanent-fixture-in-the-kardashian-family><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Larsa Became A Permanent Fixture In The Kardashian Family</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Kim and Larsa continued to hang out with one another socially, they naturally began blending their social circles, and Larsa became heavily immersed with the entire Kardashian clan. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She formed friendships with Khloe Kardashian </a>and the other Kardashian sisters and became a visible, seemingly permanent fixture in the lives of the Kardashians. Larsa supported Kim through her divorce from Kris Humphries and was part of every birthday celebration that the large family threw. She even vacationed with the Kardashians, further demonstrating her intimate bond with the entire family.</p><h2 id=something-seemed-39-off-39-in-2020><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Something Seemed 'Off' In 2020</span></h2><p>Many years passed with many milestone moments shared between Larsa Pippen and the Kardashians. It became second nature for fans to associate her with the family. Then, in 2020, something seemed to be "off," in the sense that tension seemed to exist between Larsa and the Kardashian sisters. Eyebrows began to raise when <strong><a href=#>Khloe Kardashian </a></strong>rang in her 36th birthday without Larsa in sight, and not long afterwards, Larsa celebrated her birthday, and it was clear that the Kardashians weren't included in her festivities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-kardashians-and-larsa-pippen-39-unfollowed-39-one-another><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Kardashians And Larsa Pippen 'Unfollowed' One Another</span></h2><p>Eagle-eyed fans knew something wasn't quite right, so they did some digging. It was then revealed that the Kardashians and Larsa Pippen were no longer following one another on social media. In a world where "likes" and online social support by fellow celebrities is a huge focal point, this simple act of silently "unfollowing" one another behind-the-scenes was actually a loud declaration that any bonds Kim and Larsa had previously formed were definitely broken. Their de-friending was official.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Larsa Pippen Branded 'Desperate' By Fans As She 'Begs' For Kim K's Friendship Back</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=larsa-pippen-started-dishing-the-dirt-about-tristan-thompson><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Larsa Pippen Started Dishing The Dirt About Tristan Thompson</span></h2><p>The world of reality TV demands drama, by nature, and Larsa Pippen was ready to live up to the expectation. She went from being totally silent about her fallout with the Kardashians, to suddenly being very vocal about it. She took to the airwaves to trash the family, and during her segment on The Hollywood Raw, Pippen stunned fans by declaring that she had been dating Tristan Thompson at the time she introduced him to Khloe, which was mere days before Tristan and Khloe declared themselves as an official couple. The declaration that she was with Tristan before Khloe was sent shockwaves through the internet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=larsa-points-the-finger-at-kanye-west><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Larsa Points The Finger At Kanye West</span></h2><p>It seemed that when she started to unleash her secrets to the world, Lasa Pippen just couldn't seem to stop. During the podcast, she continued to dish all the dirt she had kept quiet about for so long and stunned fans with more huge allegations, this time, against <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong>. Larsa claimed Kanye had been "brainwashing" the Kardashians and making them turn against her. She then indicated that Kanye used to call her regularly to vent his own frustration against the Kardashians. She clearly pointed the finger at Kanye for being the reason that her relationship with Kim and her sisters became strained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=larsa-pippen-calls-out-travis-scott><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Larsa Pippen Calls Out Travis Scott</span></h2><p>Nothing seemed to be sacred, and even Travis Scott's reputation was dragged during Larsa Pippen's tell-all moment. She used her platform to call out the entire family and went on to expose Travis' extracurricular habits, in the process. At one point Travis Scott had told the Kardashians he felt Larsa was flirting with him, and Larsa fired back publicly by stating that Travis was routinely high and was likely not thinking or observing the situation clearly at the time he made the statement.</p><h2 id=the-kardashians-slam-back-against-larsa-pippen-39-s-39-toxic-energy-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Kardashians Slam Back Against Larsa Pippen's 'Toxic Energy'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Larsa Pippen used her public platform to essentially trash the Kardashian family, they responded by blocking her out of their empire and trying to tarnish her reputation. The Kardashians refused to connect themselves to Larsa any further, pulling their influence and privileges away from her instantly. They also began releasing statements to the media, calling Larsa out for having "toxic energy" and stating that they had no room or patience for her behavior, and just like that, Larsa was cut off.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Larsa Pippen Gets Slammed For Being Proud Of Her Side-Piece Status</a></span></p><h2 id=larsa-is-willing-to-patch-things-up-now-that-kanye-is-gone><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Larsa Is Willing To Patch Things Up Now That Kanye Is Gone</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After all that drama and dragging, the dust seems to have settled in Larsa Pippen's life and her tone has recently changed. She came forward in the spring of 2021 to state that her major falling out was never with Kim Kardashian at all; it was due to Kanye West's meddling and negative commentary. She then went on to state that now that he and Kim are divorced, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she is willing to repair her relationship </a>with Kim and pick up where they left off before this spat.</p><h2 id=the-power-lies-in-kim-kardashian-39-s-hands><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Power Lies In Kim Kardashian's Hands</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every friendship and relationship journeys through highs and lows, and now, the sisterly bond that was once shared by Kim Kardashian and Larsa Pippen sits entirely in Kim's hands. Larsa has already put it "out there" that she's willing to resume their friendship, and <a href=#>Kim has publicly declared that she's going to remain single</a> despite Kanye's numerous attempts to get her back. Now that he's not a permanent fixture in Kim's daily life, Larsa is ready to be friends again. However, the power lies with Kim, and she hasn't yet declared whether or not she's willing to let Larsa Pippen back into her inner circle.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Finally Passes Baby Bar Law Exam</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmK5or7SmmSpoaClsq95xaugnqaUqLWqvIyiqqytlah6psTPpZiippWZfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkim-kardashian-larsa-pippen-friendship-issues-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkim-kardashian-larsa-pippen-friendship-issues-explained.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkim-kardashian-larsa-pippen-friendship-issues-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkim-kardashian-larsa-pippen-friendship-issues-explained.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkim-kardashian-larsa-pippen-friendship-issues-explained.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkim-kardashian-larsa-pippen-friendship-issues-explained.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lana-condor-weight-gain-health-update-672992-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lana-condor-weight-gain-health-update-672992-html.html>Lana Condor Weight Gain | Health Update</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kayden-magnuson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-44292-html.html>Kayden Magnuson Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kayden-magnuson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-44292-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
