Lawrence is so down-to-earth and real that she even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gets stage fright and drinks wine </a>before going onstage. Whenever the actress is interviewed, fans feel like they're listening to a good friend talk about their lives, hopes, and dreams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stars who J-Law fights with</a>&nbsp;but Hemsworth isn't one of them.&nbsp;In fact, the two have a very good relationship, and fans would love to learn more about how they feel about each other. Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=best-friends>Best Friends</h2><p>It's fun to learn <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">behind-the-scenes facts about The Hunger Games</a>&nbsp;and there's one big question on everyone's minds: do the two main stars get along?</p><p>Jennifer Lawrence said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Liam&nbsp;Hemsworth is her best friend</a>, so that seems to be the nature of their relationship. According to&nbsp;E Online, Lawrence said that she's "a wimp" and has trouble with "negotiating" and asking for what she wants. She said that in contrast, Hemsworth is amazing with negotiation, and he has really inspired her to stick up for herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress continued that she's been shocked that she's BFFs with such an attractive guy. She said, "I guess the thing that surprised me is that I would never expect to ever have a man this good-looking ever be my best friend. I just would never assume those things could happen, but he is. He's the most wonderful, lovable, family-oriented, sweet, hilarious, amazing guy."</p><p>The stars seem to feel really positive about each other, so the feeling&nbsp;appears to be mutual. A few years ago, Hemsworth was interviewed by Men's Health and he talked about the celebrity pictures that were leaked. Since this included some of Lawrence's photos, he wanted to address it. The actor said, "I just don’t understand how someone can do that to another human being. It’s the hugest invasion of privacy you can think of."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Jennifer Lawrence Told Her Classmates She Had A Wooden Leg</a></span></p><h2 id=more-than-friends>More Than Friends?</h2><p>Fans are curious if Jennifer Lawrence and Liam&nbsp;Hemsworth ever wanted to be more than friends. After all, when people star in a movie together, it's easy to picture them having an actual fairy tale love story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;MSN.com, his mother is a big fan of the actress and didn't feel the same way about Miley Cyrus. A source said, "Liam's mum Leonie wanted them together years ago. She never thought Miley was good enough for her son and kept nagging him to date Jennifer instead. Now it looks like she might just get her way."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lawrence Looks Stunning In The New Dior Fall 2020 Campaign</a></span></p><p>Lawrence has also said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she and Hemsworth have kissed before</a>, which&nbsp;got the rumor mill going even more. In 2015, Lawrence went on Andy Cohen's&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live and the host asked her if they had ever kissed each other. She could have said it was too personal to talk about or deflected the question, but instead, she was super honest. Lawrence said,&nbsp;"Liam and I grew up together. Liam's real hot. What would you have done?"&nbsp;People.com&nbsp;says that Lawrence said "I gotta call Liam" when the show went on a pause for a commercial.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's definitely more to the story: according&nbsp;to&nbsp;Hollywood Life, Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus got back together in 2015 because she realized that he and Lawrence could have started seeing each other. She wasn't happy about that and she wanted to be with Hemsworth. A source explained, "When Miley realized there might be something serious between Jennifer and Liam, she decided to do something to get him back."</p><p>Cyrus wondered if a romance was in the cards as in 2015, there were rumors flying about whether they were in a relationship. A source said that Lawrence would phone him a lot, according to&nbsp;Hollywood Life, and because she had broken up with Chris Martin, she was free and single once again.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18 Little Known Facts About Jennifer Lawrence’s Rise To Fame</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=off-the-market>Off The Market</h2><p>Fans of Lawrence and Hemsworth who would like to see the two together are out of luck, however. No one knows if the two dated briefly or if they have just always been good pals. But Lawrence is officially off the market and has been for a little while now, and Hemsworth isn't single anymore, either.</p><p>According to&nbsp;People.com, Lawrence married Cooke Maroney in Rhode Island in October 2019. 150 people were there. The couple started seeing each other in June 2018.</p><p>As for Hemsworth, he started dating&nbsp;Gabriella Brooks in the spring of 2020. She is 23 years old and from Sydney, Australia, according to&nbsp;E Online, so the couple has a shared background in common.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lawrence Got Back To Social Media To Ask People To Vote</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irsGptc2gZLCdXaC7sMOMmpmoraRit6a6zaKdnqpdoa64vsSnmp5lkaOxbrjImqRmoJWiwLi70a2frGWimrmiwMiopaygmaV8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feverything-we-know-about-jennifer-lawrence-and-liam-hemsworths-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feverything-we-know-about-jennifer-lawrence-and-liam-hemsworths-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feverything-we-know-about-jennifer-lawrence-and-liam-hemsworths-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feverything-we-know-about-jennifer-lawrence-and-liam-hemsworths-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feverything-we-know-about-jennifer-lawrence-and-liam-hemsworths-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feverything-we-know-about-jennifer-lawrence-and-liam-hemsworths-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hailey-bieber-leather-jacket-amazon-fashion.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hailey-bieber-leather-jacket-amazon-fashion.html>Hailey Biebers Leather Jacket Look Will Be Your Fall Uniform</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1190305-el-hijo-del-fantasma-attacks-drake-maverick-unmasks-as-santos-escobar.html>El Hijo del Fantasma Attacks Drake Maverick, Unmasks As Santos Escobar</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1190305-el-hijo-del-fantasma-attacks-drake-maverick-unmasks-as-santos-escobar.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
