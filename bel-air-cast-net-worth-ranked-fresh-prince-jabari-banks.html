Some of them are newcomers to the acting world, while others are veterans to it. It would be impossible to rank the actors by skill having not seen the show yet, so the only way to do it would be from lowest to highest net worth. If this show is a success, these net worths are subject to change. Here is the cast of Bel-Air, ranked by net worth.</p><h2 id=jabari-banks---100-000-to-125-000><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Jabari Banks - $100,000 To $125,000</span></h2><p>Jabari Banks plays the main character of Will Smith, who gets shipped to Bel-Air, CA, from West Philadelphia, after he gets into some trouble.
