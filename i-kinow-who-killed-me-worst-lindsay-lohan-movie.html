Let's take a look at the movie that people say is the worst one that Lindsay Lohan ever starred in.</p><h2 id=39-i-know-who-killed-me-39>'I Know Who Killed Me'</h2><p>I Know Who Killed Me was released in 2007, which came just a few years after Lindsay Lohan wowed audiences in 2004's Mean Girls. But while <a href=#>fans love Mean Girls to this day</a>, they can't say the same about this film. After starring in 2004's Freaky Friday and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, Lindsay Lohan was in 2006's Just My Luck and Bobby. In 2007, she starred in Georgia Rule and Labor Pains, but it was I Know Who Killed Me that really got people talking... and not in a good way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lindsay Lohan played the main character, Aubrey Fleming. After being taken by a serial killer, Aubrey ends up in the hospital but says that she's really Dakota Moss who is a stripper. The movie starts to get even stranger, as a therapist suggests that Dakota is an alter ego that Aubrey has made up so she can cope with the awful traumatic situation that she has been in.</p><p>I Know Who Killed Me has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">26% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes</a> and is ranked 9% on the Tomatometer. The website's Critic Consensus section describes the movie as "Distasteful and ludicrously plotted" and that is definitely the general feeling surrounding it. When Aubrey's computer is found and searched, FBI agents discover that Aubrey wrote a short story mentioning Dakota, the character's twin. Once Aubrey's DNA is taken, she is definitely proven to be Aubrey, and not Dakota.</p><p>The fan reviews on Rotten Tomatoes prove that no one felt that this was a stand-out project. One fan wrote, "Very confusing. It made very little sense" and another said, "A terrible Lindsay Lohan vehicle that boasts awful acting, script, and plot. Overall, a miss."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The majority of reviews call the movie confusing, with one person talking about the big plot holes in the film. The movie suggests that the woman everyone thinks is Aubrey is really Dakota, as the movie ends with Dakota finding her twin's killer and then finding Aubrey's body.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Megan Fox And Lindsay Lohan's 'Rivalry'</a></span></p><p>When someone asked about this movie in a Reddit thread, one fan said that they enjoy revisiting it as the movie just isn't very good: "I Know Who Killed Me is one of my favorite so-bad-it's-good movies. I had a blast watching it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Entertainment Weekly reviewed the film with the headline "I Saw It, So You Don't Have To." The reviewer, Michael Slezak, mentioned how strange it is that the movie has a very blue tone. The review included a great multiple choice quiz about the confusing events in the movie.</p><p>Fans were so disappointed by this movie that they didn't think that Lindsay should have agreed to play the part of Aubrey/Dakota. As one fan shared on Rotten Tomatoes, "There are hints of what appears to be an earnest vision, but it seems to be lost amongst the cluttered identity crisis the overall film has in attempting to provide twists while wandering aimlessly between genres and at times more a Music video sensation than an actual film. As for Lindsay, probably the worst choice she's ever made in her acting career."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan Was Almost Cast On This Popular 2000s Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=behind-the-scenes>Behind-The-Scenes</h2><p>Garcelle Beauvais, star of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, shared that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was in I Know Who Killed Me with Lindsay Lohan.</a> According to Cheat Sheet, Garcelle said, "That was a disaster. Because, at the time, this was in the middle of all her craziness, right? And we had to stop production because she wouldn’t show up and all of that stuff.”</p><p>Garcelle shared that Lindsay used cue cards to film the movie, which is definitely surprising to hear: "they had the biggest cue cards. And she was literally reading from a cue card and I had never seen that before in my life. I was just like, ‘Oh my god.’ And we got through the movie doing it that way.”</p><p>When Lindsay was filming I Know Who Killed Me, she was also hospitalized for dehydration. According to People.com, Lindsay went to rehab and told her fans, “I have made a proactive decision to take care of my personal health. I appreciate your well wishes and ask that you please respect my privacy at this time.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Wilmer Valderrama Did This For Lindsay Lohan While They Were Dating</a></span></p><p>I Know Who Killed Me is definitely the most confusing movie that Lindsay Lohan has ever starred in and it's no wonder that so many fans still remember it to this day.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Truth About Why This Lindsay Lohan Co-Star Disappeared From Acting</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigZqOZo7y4edahpmajmaG5prCMppxmr5%2BnwLV5y6KlnauRrnqtu8eapWaln6u2pnmO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-kinow-who-killed-me-worst-lindsay-lohan-movie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fi-kinow-who-killed-me-worst-lindsay-lohan-movie.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fi-kinow-who-killed-me-worst-lindsay-lohan-movie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fi-kinow-who-killed-me-worst-lindsay-lohan-movie.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-kinow-who-killed-me-worst-lindsay-lohan-movie.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-kinow-who-killed-me-worst-lindsay-lohan-movie.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./frank-gonzales-bio-wiki-age-height-dating-movies-saw-and-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./frank-gonzales-bio-wiki-age-height-dating-movies-saw-and-net-worth.html>Frank Gonzales Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Dating, Movies, SAW and Net Worth.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./evan-tan-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-148729-html.html>Evan Tan Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./evan-tan-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-148729-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
