Together, they built a large family with six children -- Maddox, 22, Pax, 20, Zahara, 18, Shiloh, 17, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 15. But only two years after legally tying the knot, Angelina surprised fans by filing for divorce. And so ensued years of legal battles, even until today, despite their <a href=#>messy Hollywood divorce</a> being finalized years ago.</p><p>The catalyst for Brad and Angelina’s divorce was a simple one for Angelina. The divorce <a href=#>occurred after an alleged altercation that took place on their private jet</a> in front of their kids in 2016.</p><p>Initially, Angelina was granted physical custody of their six kids, while Brad only had visitation rights. He was given joint custody in May 2021. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">However, Angelina later won an appeal against the joint custody</a>. She currently retains sole custody, while Brad has visitation of their minor children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the complicated family dynamic, many fans wonder how close Brad is to his kids.

Because of this, he spends time with Shiloh, Vivienne, and Knox. It is Maddox who wants nothing to do with his father, and recently, it seems like <a href=#>Pax is angry with his father, too</a>. What is interesting is that Zahara dropped Pitt from her last name, something that Maddox and Shiloh had already done. Whether the rest of the kids will follow suit remains to be seen.</p><h2 id=brad-pitt-rsquo-s-oldest-kids-were-refusing-to-speak-to-him-according-to-rumors>Brad Pitt’s Oldest Kids Were Refusing To Speak To Him, According To Rumors</h2><h3 id=maddox-jolie-is-the-only-child-not-talking-to-brad-pitt-these-days>Maddox Jolie Is The Only Child Not Talking To Brad Pitt These Days</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brad-pitt-and-his-children-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brad’s relationship with his children has been complicated following his divorce from Angelina. In 2020, Us Weekly reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his eldest sons, Maddox and Pax, weren’t speaking to him</a> following the plane altercation that happened years ago. However, Brad reportedly remained active in his younger kids’ lives.</p><p>Case in point: according to a source who spoke with Us Weekly, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He flew to Italy for the twins’ birthday</a> and that meant a lot to them, plus he made a big fuss of Shiloh on her 16th."</p><p>It certainly seems, then, as though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad is still on good terms with his younger kids</a>, and things have improved as they’ve gotten older.</p><p>"Brad has dinner with his younger kids when they are all in L.A.," a source explained. "Since the kids are older now, they have their own life and friends. But, Brad still has a pretty good relationship with them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It appeared that, except for Maddox, the relationship between the older kids was on its way to being mended as well. That is until <a href=#>Pax seemingly slammed his father for being an absentee dad</a> in a secret Instagram post.</p><p>But with that said, when Zahara was introducing herself to her sorority, she introduced herself as "Zahara Jolie." The Pitt had been dropped from her name, something that Maddox, and according to some sources, Shiloh had already done in the past. Whether that is a signal of more of an alliance to Angelina than Brad remains to be seen. However, it speaks volumes to just how close Brad is with some of his children that they have made the decision as they have gotten older to take the hyphenate out of their name.</p><h2 id=brad-pitt-allegedly-doesn-rsquo-t-force-his-kids-to-see-him>Brad Pitt Allegedly Doesn’t Force His Kids To See Him</h2><h3 id=even-after-winning-joint-custody-brad-pitt-did-not-make-his-kids-have-visitation-time>Even After Winning Joint Custody, Brad Pitt Did Not Make His Kids Have Visitation Time</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brad-pitt-at-press-conference.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brad has spent years fighting Angelina in court for joint custody, and he continues to.

It’s also unclear how close he was with them before the divorce. Brad’s parenting came under fire after Angelina left him. Not only was she granted custody, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad was investigated for foul play</a>. The Los Angeles' Department of Children and Family Services later cleared him of the charges.</p><p>With this in mind, it’s possible that the kids’ relationship with Brad was slightly strained before his marital strife with Angelina was publicized.</p><p>He does have visitation rights and coupled with reports from sources who say he’s on good terms with his younger kids, Brad appears active to an extent with some of his children. But this likely can’t be said about his eldest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His court-ordered visitation can’t be enforced on any of his children who are no longer minors. Right now, this includes his eldest sons Maddox, 22, and Pax, 20, who he’s reportedly had the most tenuous relationship. Daughter Zahara is now also 18.</p><p>Though Brad is currently entitled to time with his younger kids, it won’t be long before they start aging out of the visitation order.

I heard one lawyer say, 'No one wins in court—it's just a matter of who gets hurt worse.' And it seems to be true, you spend a year just focused on building a case to prove your point and why you're right and why they're wrong, and it's just an investment in vitriolic hatred."</p><p><strong>"I just refuse. And fortunately, my partner in this agrees," Brad continued. "It's just very, very jarring for the kids, to suddenly have their family ripped apart…. If anyone can make sense of it, we have to with great care and delicacy, building everything around that."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Time will tell if Brad Pitt's relationship with his kids will improve as they come of age.
