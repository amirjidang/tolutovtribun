That makes her 56, a remarkable age for such a graceful woman.&nbsp;</p><p>She was born in The Soviet Union era of Russia and hails from a Jewish background. As Victoria has kept most of her details private, we do not know further details regarding her parents and background.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the era in which she was born was highly sensitive in nature, Victoria Chlebowski’s parents decided to migrate to America. There is <a href=#>news</a> that at the time of the family’s migration, Victoria was only 16 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>She attended a private high school in California at the time (through which it is known she was 16 at the time).

The couple has also partnered together to inaugurate Studio Dante, an off-broadway theater where Victoria’s husband served as an art director, due to his background in film and TV.</p><p>Victoria Chlebowski also has credit in Joy de V, a New York noir, dramatic thriller genre film which was released in the year 2013 and was written and directed by Nadia Szold.

Vadim attended Santa Barbara High School and then went on to pursue further education at Purchase College.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Change of Faith</h2><p>Victoria belongs to a Christian family but both she and her husband have shifted to Buddhism. This dates back to college days when she used to read Buddhist books and practice philosophy.&nbsp;</p><p>It is stated in places that she began to develop an interest in the faith from there.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon gaining interest, she shared her findings with Michael. He also got interested and they both started to pursue more knowledge regarding the subject.&nbsp;</p><p>They have been seen visiting many events such as visiting Buddhist monks. Some of the monks they have visited are Dalai Lama, Sogyal Rinpoche, Gelek Rinpoche, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>They follow the dedicated teachings of the said lamas and barely miss any of the events. Victoria’s behavior had a sudden change when she started pursuing Buddhism.&nbsp;</p><p>Her tolerance levels have increased along with her patience, which has greatly inspired her family. She is also said to have attained an elevated piece of mind.&nbsp;</p><p>She also meditates early in the morning with her husband.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth and Further News of Victoria</h2><p>Due to her being a businesswoman, her estimated net worth is certainly more than USD $100,000.</p><p>Recent news regarding her was when she contracted COVID-19. Her husband Michael announced the news that he was sure he also contracted the virus along with his son and wife.&nbsp;</p><p>They were also involved with selling and purchasing additional properties.
