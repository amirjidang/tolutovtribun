<time>12 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Thanks to things like social media, it is easier than ever for celebrities to face a backlash. After all, stars can be called out for so many things these days. For example, Florence Pugh was so hated for dating Zach Braff that it may have <a href=#>affected her relationship with Charlie Gooch</a> and <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez's alcohol brand made people mad</a> too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for Rob Dyrdek, he has been the subject of controversy before because of <a href=#>how he met his wife</a>. However, some observers have been shocked that Dyrdek hasn't faced more of a backlash for selling out considering how some of his peers have been treated.</p><h2 id=why-hasn-39-t-rob-dyrdek-faced-a-backlash>Why Hasn't Rob Dyrdek Faced A Backlash?</h2><p>Throughout much of modern history, the idea of mainstream celebrities starring in commercials was heavily frowned upon. As a result, in the past when movie stars wanted to cash in on their celebrity, they typically would only star in commercials that aired overseas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bam-margera-and-steve-o-1.jpg><p>Over the last several years, that has changed as it is now common for stars to headline advertisements. Fans even became so used to Matthew McConaughey starring in indecipherable Lincoln commercials that Saturday Night Live spoofed those ads.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, there are still some celebrities who are heavily criticized for so-called selling out and there have been many examples of that in the skateboarding community. Some former Pro skateboarders who've received a backlash for selling out include Bam Margera, Steve-O, and Ryan Sheckler.</p><p>In Sheckler and Margera's cases, the backlash largely focused on them becoming reality stars. Among many fans that follow celebrities that have been pro skateboarders, Margera and Sheckler sold out because they prioritized their reality shows over skating.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Bam Margera Pay Child Support For His Son Phoenix?</a></span></p><p>Similar to Sheckler and Margera, Steve-O has recently been on the receiving end of a lot of anger from fans. Things actually got so bad that when Wee Man went on Steve-O's Wild Ride podcast, the former Jackass stars <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke at length about the backlashes they have received</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to Steve-O, he has angered fans for two main reasons in recent years. First off, Steve-O has been criticized for how he has treated fans he has interacted with even though everyone should understand stars have bad days. Secondly, some of Steve-O's followers have complained about how hard he tries to sell products to his followers.</p><p>Looking at the backlashes that many pro skaters have received for selling out, a Reddit user who went by u/Skate4food posted about his confusion. As u/Skate4foodexplained in his Reddit post, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">questioned why Rob Dyrdek hasn't suffered the same kind of backlash</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rob-dyrdek-wearing-a-collared-shirt.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"First of all, I'm not taking anything away from Rob. He's a pro skater and does so much for the skating community (safe spots, street league, etc.), but is he a bit over the top? I mean the whole MTV thing is debatable. When Sheckler had his own MTV show he got hated on so much, and Sheckler rips way harder than Dyrdek."</p><p>u/Skate4food continued, "What made me post this was seeing a Rob Dyrdek ad on every youtube video I watched for a car. People gave Bam Margera tons of hatred for being a sellout and a mediocre skater. My opinion is neutral towards Rob. Any thoughts guys."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Johnny Knoxville Is Facing Multiple Lawsuits Because Of Jackass</a></span></p><p>Looking back on u/Skate4food's post, it is easy to see why he was so confused. By the time of that post, Dyrdek had already done all the things that have made fans made at other pro skaters including plugging merchandise, starring in a reality show, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In response to u/Skate4food's post, several Reddit users came forward to explain why Dyrdek isnâ€™t hated the same way as some of his peers are. The top-voted post read, "Say what you will, but the guy loves skateboarding. I can get behind anyone with that kind of passion."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rob-dyrdek-wearing-dc-and-monster-gear.jpg><p>The second most upvoted response simply opted to praise Dyrdek for his business acumen. "You have to admit that he's amazing at business." Most notably, a user who went by u/sk8nisntacrime99 responded to u/Skate4food's post with a lengthy explanation of what they thought made Dyrdek different.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Dyrdek has been a pro for like 20 something years, hes old and having a career that long is impressive. He does everything he can to help out skateboarding. I do have to agree some of his stuff goes to the point of stupid but we all have our moments!"</p><h2 id=how-much-is-rob-dyrdek-39-s-net-worth>How Much Is Rob Dyrdek's Net Worth?</h2><p>For anyone to be accused of selling out, they first have to be in a position where it looks like they are trying to get rich. Since people have questioned why Rob Dyrdek hasn't been accused of selling out, that begs an obvious question, how wealthy is he?</p><p>After Dyrdek began skateboarding at only twelve years old, he got his first sponsorship deal at age fifteen. Ever since then, Dyrdek has proven to be one of the shrewdest business minds in the history of pro skateboarders.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Bam Margera And Steve-O Still Friends Today?</a></span></p><p>When Dyrdek was seventeen years old, he founded his first company which sold skateboard accessories. Since forming that company, Dyrdek has cemented his reputation as an entrepreneur by shepherding several successful businesses into the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to the success Dyrdek has enjoyed as a business leader, he has accomplished something else that was equally unlikely. Since the mid-2000s, Dyrdek has become a legitimate television star who has a lot of experience behind the scenes as well.</p><p>From 2006 until 2008, Dyrdek co-starred in a reality show with the lovable Christopher "Big Black" Boykin who sadly has since passed. Titled Rob & Big, the duo's show became such a big hit for MTV that when it ended, Dyrdek almost immediately returned to the network with another show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rob-dyrdek-filming-ridiculousness.jpg><p>Since 2006, Dyrdek has worked consistently as an onscreen talent for MTV. Some of the shows that Dyrdek has starred in include Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory, Ridiculousness, and Amazingness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of being a TV star, Dyrdek has also created and produced many shows for MTV including the aforementioned shows he starred in. Dyrdek has also been the creator and producer of several shows he didn't star in like The Dude Perfect Show.</p><p>Thanks to all of Dyrdek's successful financial ventures, he has amassed a truly impressive fortune, to say the least. According to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dyrdek has a $100 million fortune</a> as of this writing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipqJpdmcazsMSkZJqun56xprCMm5ico5yWwKl5w56qqaGkmnq0u8yeZJudnJ6yt7XNoGShnV2ovK2wjKisrWWTlr%2BmsdFmq6hlnZa4pnnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frob-dyrdek-avoided-backlash-despite-some-believing-he-sold-out-career-to-make-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frob-dyrdek-avoided-backlash-despite-some-believing-he-sold-out-career-to-make-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frob-dyrdek-avoided-backlash-despite-some-believing-he-sold-out-career-to-make-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frob-dyrdek-avoided-backlash-despite-some-believing-he-sold-out-career-to-make-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frob-dyrdek-avoided-backlash-despite-some-believing-he-sold-out-career-to-make-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frob-dyrdek-avoided-backlash-despite-some-believing-he-sold-out-career-to-make-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./shi-yuqi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-477130-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./shi-yuqi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-477130-html.html>Shi Yuqi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rhoslc-meredith-marks-has-three-children-with-husband-seth-brooks-reid-and-chloe-403063-html.html>RHOSLC Meredith Marks Has Three Children With Husband Seth -Brooks, Reid, And Chloe</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rhoslc-meredith-marks-has-three-children-with-husband-seth-brooks-reid-and-chloe-403063-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
