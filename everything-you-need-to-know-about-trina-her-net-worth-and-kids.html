<time>09 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Trina is an American rap artist who first became known in 1998 after she appeared on Miami rapper, Trick Daddy’s second studio album&nbsp;<i>www.thug.com</i>&nbsp;on the single “Nann Nigga“. Before then, she worked as a real estate agent and&nbsp;wrote rap rhymes in her spare time.</p><p>Her raw talent for writing raps&nbsp;drew the attention of Trick Daddy who asked her to feature on his song&nbsp;“Nann Nigga”. Following the success of the single, Trina became popular, attracting a record deal with&nbsp;Slip-n-Slide Records&nbsp;with distribution from&nbsp;Atlantic Records and subsequently started working towards building her own music career.</p><p>The award-winning rapper described as&nbsp;the most consistent female rapper of all time by the&nbsp;<i>XXL Magazine</i>&nbsp;has released&nbsp;five studio albums since she kicked off her professional music career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=trinas-bio-and-all-you-need-to-know></span><strong>Trina’s Bio and All&nbsp;You Need To Know</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Katrina Laverne Taylor, better known by her stage name, Trina, was born on&nbsp;December 3, 1974, in Miami, Florida. Her mother and father are from The Bahamas and&nbsp;the Dominican Republic respectively, however, they&nbsp;went their separate ways while Trina was still a child. The celebrity rapper, who once lived in&nbsp;Liberty City and in Pembroke Isle, Florida, graduated in 1992 from Miami Northwestern Senior High School, where she was a majorette.</p><p>Trina released her debut album,&nbsp;“Da Baddest Bitch” on March 21, 2000. The album made its debut on&nbsp;the US&nbsp;Billboard 200 and&nbsp;on the&nbsp;Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums&nbsp;chart at numbers 33 and 11 respectively. While it remained on the&nbsp;Billboard 200&nbsp;for 39 weeks, the hit album spent&nbsp;49 weeks back to back on the&nbsp;Hip-Hop/R&B album chart. Eight months later, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).</p><p>Sequel to the first album was a lead single “Da Baddest Bitch” released in February 2000 and&nbsp;“Pull Over”, released in June 2000. Unlike the debut album, the preceding lead singles did not enjoy as much recognition.</p><p>At the end of promotion for her&nbsp;debut album in mid-2000, Trina started working towards releasing her second album, recording her music with Missy Elliott. She was very much in charge, choosing her own production, song titles and had the freedom to write whatever she wanted to write, unlike her first album where she had no creative control. After recording from 2000 to 2002, Trina was ready to bring something fresh to the table and on&nbsp;August 27, 2002, she released her second album “Diamond Princess”&nbsp;which sold&nbsp;67,000 copies within the first week of its release.</p><p>Following the album was three singles&nbsp;“Told Y’all”, featuring&nbsp;Rick Ross,&nbsp;“No Panties”, featuring&nbsp;Tweet and&nbsp;“B R Right”, featuring&nbsp;Ludacris. Also in 2002, Trina established her own&nbsp;record label, Diva Enterprises (now DP Entertainment).</p><p>In 2005, the female hip-hop musician released her third studio album “Glamorest Life”, selling&nbsp;77,000 units in its first week. The album was eventually followed by two singles,&nbsp;“Don’t Trip”, featuring&nbsp;Lil Wayne&nbsp;and&nbsp;“Here We Go” featuring&nbsp;Kelly Rowland. The latter became Trina’s first ever successful single and in June 2006, it was certified Gold in the US.</p><p>Moving forward, the rapper left Atlantic Records in 2007 and pitched her tent with&nbsp;Slip-n-Slide Records, her original label and kicked off work on her fourth studio album, “Still da Baddest”&nbsp;which was later released on&nbsp;April 1, 2008, and sold&nbsp;47,000 in the first week. The album was Trina’s first to top the chart at number 6 0n&nbsp;the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;200 and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.&nbsp;“Single Again”, “I Got a Thang for You“, featuring&nbsp;Keyshia Cole and “Look Back at Me”, featuring Killer Mike,&nbsp;were the preceding lead singles in order of release.</p><p>2008 also saw Trina welcome the establishment of Pretty Money, a rap duo based in Miami with&nbsp;members Nisha and An-G. Although the group was intended to be featured on&nbsp;Trina’s fifth studio album, it never happened and until now, it is yet to come up with any music. After the group was established, Trina started work on her fifth album,&nbsp;Amazin’, which was released on&nbsp;May 4, 2010. The sales were low with little over 32,000 copies sold in its first week. However, the album enjoyed good reviews from critics. Before the album was released, a lead single from it, “That’s My Attitude”, was released followed by two promo mixtapes in 2009 and 2010.</p><p>In readiness for her sixth studio album which is still in view, Trina released three singles from the mixtape titled “Diamonds Are Forever”&nbsp;on March 28, 2011, before she later released the mixtape in full. Within two days, it recorded 4.8 million views. On September 15, 2014, she released the single “Fuck Love”, for her upcoming album.</p><p>Following the announcement that she had left&nbsp;Slip-N-Slide Records, the artist revealed on March 9, 2015, that she was now signed to Penalty Entertainment.</p><p>Apart from her music, Trina also works on&nbsp;VH1&nbsp;as a&nbsp;co-host on&nbsp;Tameka Cottle’s late night talk show,&nbsp;<i>Tiny Tonight,</i>&nbsp;together with Cottle, Tamar Braxton, and&nbsp;&nbsp;Claudia Jordan. She is also one of the major cast of the&nbsp;season of&nbsp;<i>Love & Hip Hop: Miami</i>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span><strong>Net Worth&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Trina has been very active in the music industry since she made her debut in 1998 and has made a lot of money from her many albums, singles, and mixtapes. Apart from music, the&nbsp;Diamond Princess is also involved in radio and TV shows. She has&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;Tax USA commercial and is one of the&nbsp;faces of&nbsp;Body of Royalty, a cosmetics company&nbsp;best-known for lipstick, concealer, 100% mink eyelashes, lip gloss, etc. She is said to have an estimated net worth of $6 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kids></span><strong>Kids</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Though popular for being a musician, Trina does not have just music on her mind. The&nbsp;self-proclaimed “baddest bitch” is also thinking of having her own babies someday. However, her biggest delay is finding her Mr, Right. According to the super lady who spoke about the subject in 2015, she loves kids but for her to have a child, she would prefer to have a family rather than being somebody’s&nbsp;baby mama.</p><p>Years have gone by and it seems the talented lady has finally found her man. Even though there is no news of her getting married yet, Trina is currently pregnant with her first baby.&nbsp;The rapper and her boyfriend – who is said to be a wealthy “White Cuban” from Florida, are reportedly very happy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ2mmr%2B6wMeipaBlqaTCbrrEnptmrJ9iuK%2B71maYm6elqXq1vsinmGaglad6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqK6w2aiopyjZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feverything-you-need-to-know-about-trina-her-net-worth-and-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feverything-you-need-to-know-about-trina-her-net-worth-and-kids.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feverything-you-need-to-know-about-trina-her-net-worth-and-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feverything-you-need-to-know-about-trina-her-net-worth-and-kids.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feverything-you-need-to-know-about-trina-her-net-worth-and-kids.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feverything-you-need-to-know-about-trina-her-net-worth-and-kids.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./taylor-swift-enforces-rule-that-her-closest-celeb-friends-must-attend-concerts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./taylor-swift-enforces-rule-that-her-closest-celeb-friends-must-attend-concerts.html>Fans Completely Disagree With A 'Rule' Taylor Swift Enforces On Her Closest Celeb Friends</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./everything-you-need-to-know-about-jason-clarke-biography.html>Everything You Need To Know About Jason Clarke Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./everything-you-need-to-know-about-jason-clarke-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
