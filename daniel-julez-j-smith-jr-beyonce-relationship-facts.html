However, while not many details are known about Skai and Julez's relationship, like when it actually began or ended, it reportedly took a turn for the worst after Julez confirmed in an Instagram Q&A that the two were no longer on good terms.</p><h2 id=skai-jackson-accused-of-cheating-on-julez-smith>Skai Jackson Accused of Cheating on Julez Smith</h2><p>Account Lurking In The City also shared a screenshot via Julez' social media that was reportedly in reference to Skai where he then said, "I don't like her like this don't believe what other people say…. and her personality, and her ego is very big… she needs to come [down] back to earth."</p><p>Around the same time as all of this information was coming to light, a series of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">screenshots went viral accusing Skai of cheating on him</a>. In the same group chat, Julez can be seen admitting that he allegedly slept with Skai and then "got her addicted and then left her," and that he made sure to "ruin her life" after claiming that she cheated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki Minaj Asks Instagram Friends For New Hair Advice; Skai Jackson Answers</a></span></p><p>Another in the group chat seemed to be shocked by their age gap, as Skai is 19 and Julez is only 16, to which Julez was quick to respond with, "age doesn't matter."</p><h2 id=leaked-dms>Leaked DMs</h2><p>A separate series of DMs between Julez and another person has also been circulating on social media, where Julez appears to be getting heated when the unknown person messages him saying, "There's way more s**t you have done, let's see what the judge says about that," to which Julez responds in a series of messages, also saying, "My aunt is Beyoncé, you really think I'm gonna get sued, take a next guess f***ing idiot."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While many people on social media are sharing that series of DMs saying it was between Julez and Skai, the actress actually responded to a re-post of these DMs on Lurking In The City's Instagram, saying, "These messages are NOT with me. Thank you. Please don't spread false info."</p><h2 id=leaked-video-showing-intimate-moments-between-them>Leaked Video Showing Intimate Moments Between Them</h2><p>Although the various DMs and group messages have not yet been verified nor confirmed that it was Julez making these claims, things have since worsened as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Skai Jackson" began trending on Twitter</a> after an alleged leaked video of the two being intimate made its way around the internet and what appears to be a photo of the two was also shared online, where many were quick to point out that Disney Channel Jessie poster behind Skai who was sitting on Julez' shoulders, alluding to the fact that this was likely taken at her home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=skai-jackson-39-s-cryptic-message>Skai Jackson's Cryptic Message</h2><p>Skai has yet to publicly speak out about the cheating allegation or rumors that she and Julez were even in a relationship. Still, fans noticed that she disabled her comments on Instagram and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted a cryptic message</a> saying, "You live, and you learn. Don't look back, just move forward. Love u guys."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Noticed This Strange Thing About Daniel Julez J. Smith Jr.'s Recent Scandal</a></span></p><p>Hollywood Unlocked also shared a post of a quote that Skai shared to her Instagram stories that read, "People have to pretend you're a bad person, so they don't feel guilty about the things they did to you."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-39-reaction-to-the-scandal>Fans' Reaction to the Scandal</h2><p>Fans have since rallied behind Skai, accusing Julez of seeking revenge on her and urging people not to search for the video online. One user tweeted, "Solange's son Julez Smith posted revenge p**n of Skai Jackson? What is the f***ing world."</p><p>Others are urging Twitter to take down anything related to either party, like one fan who wrote, "@Twitter I really don't know what needs to be done, but I highly recommend temporarily disabling anything with Skai Jackson and Julez Smith ASAP. People sharing these kids' videos like a breaking news segment, and honestly, I'm disgusted."</p><p>Regardless of who leaked the footage, another person pointed out that especially considering Julez's famous family ties, this is not an "easy" time for anyone involved, saying, "Obviously a difficult moment for Julez Smith and Skai Jackson, even to the family of the two. The truth is, mistakes are a major component of life's journey; it's rather unfortunate but let's not make it difficult for the two."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are many sides to every story, and at this time, nothing has been confirmed nor denied, so it's important fans give Skai and Julez the privacy they need to navigate this unfortunate situation. However, it's important to state it is never okay to share private or intimate footage of someone online. Fans hope this serious matter is addressed as necessary.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kourtney Kardashian Skips Met Gala In Solidarity With ‘C-List’ Sister Khloe Not Getting Invited</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqaZmrluttSlnLNlmmLArrXToWSjql2Xsrq7zZycZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGKzoq%2FTrGY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdaniel-julez-j-smith-jr-beyonce-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdaniel-julez-j-smith-jr-beyonce-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdaniel-julez-j-smith-jr-beyonce-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdaniel-julez-j-smith-jr-beyonce-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdaniel-julez-j-smith-jr-beyonce-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdaniel-julez-j-smith-jr-beyonce-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sasha-gabriella-fox-vanessa-williams-daughter-who-is.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sasha-gabriella-fox-vanessa-williams-daughter-who-is.html>Why Vanessa Williams' Daughter, Sasha Gabriella Fox, Is About To Take The World By Storm</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-james-gramenos-chicago-alison-gramenos-family-mourn-the-passing-of-the-father-figure-281424-html.html>Who Is James Gramenos Chicago?
