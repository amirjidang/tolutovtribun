Most fans started crushing on Dylan hard, especially because of his fiery chemistry with his co-star, Victoria Pedretti. While <a href=#>we don't know much about Victoria</a> or Dylan, fans have shipped the couple and there have even been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a few legitimate rumors</a> that the two on-screen lovers are a thing in real life. At least, this is what most news sources are running with. But is it true?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given Dylan's trajectory to becoming a big star, his undeniable good looks, flirty voice, and subtle charisma, it's not hard to imagine him having his pick of partners. And given his Instagram videos and presence of Instagram (as minimal as it may be), we can tell that he'd be open to a girlfriend. But is he actually with someone? Is it Victoria? Is it someone else? Or is he actually a happy single man?</p><h2 id=who-is-dylan-arnold>Who Is Dylan Arnold?</h2><p>If you're reading this, chances are you already know who Dylan Arnold is... Or, more likely, you know he's the new hot, young guy from You Season 3. Most people don't know who the 27-year-old actor actually is because he's relatively new to the game. Not only that, but he hasn't done a lot of work. At least, not yet. But the Seattle, Washington-born actor has been in a few other notable projects that may have some fans going, 'Oh, right! I remember him in that!'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Where Have You Seen The Cast Of 'You' Season Three Before?</a></span></p><p>At the beginning of Dylan's career, he was mostly acting in short films but he made his feature film debut in Matthew Lillard's Fat Kid Rules The World. By 2017, Dylan got cast in a small role in the Oscar-nominated Mudbound. Not long after, Dylan was cast as Twig in eight episodes of Nashville. After that, Dylan started getting cast in two different kinds of projects, horror films and teen-heart throb projects. For the former, Dylan got a notable role as Cameron Elam (Allyson's ex-boyfriend) in 2018's Halloween. He then returned for 2021 Halloween Kills, in which he finally gets his comeuppance for cheating on Allyson by getting brutally offed by Michael Myers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from the two Halloween movies, Dylan was also in three episodes of the Purge TV show and two episodes of Into The Dark. Then there are all the teen heart-throb projects, including After and After We Collided, where he played Noah.</p><p>On top of this, Dylan has made a name for himself in the theater world. But it was getting cast as Theo in You that really made him famous. Of course, his electric chemistry with his on-screen love interest, Victoria Pedretti didn't hurt his growing social media presence, acting resume, and rumors of them dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-dylan-arnold-actually-dating-victoria-pedretti-someone-else-or-no-one-at-all>Is Dylan Arnold Actually Dating Victoria Pedretti, Someone Else, Or No One At All?</h2><p>One thing is for sure, Victoria is not dating her co-lead, Penn Badgley. In fact, she claimed that <a href=#>her intimate scenes with Penn were 'weird'</a>. Of course, Penn is happily married in real life. But Victoria's relationship status is a bit more open for discussion. While she has been romantically linked to a few famous men, she does not appear to have been with any of them. Dylan Arnold, however, may have a bit more legitimacy as two sources have claimed that the two are secretly dating after hitting it off on the set of You, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Her</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘You’ Star Victoria Pedretti Is Reportedly Dating This Co-Star</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While their age difference in the show was a bit off, the two are actually basically the same age in real life. This, mixed with their on-screen chemistry, is why fans shipped them. But the sources have claimed that Dylan is actually with Victoria and it's not just a fan-dream.</p><p>The truth is, however, these rumors appeared prior to the season's final episode and therefore helped to up the viewership. But that doesn't necessarily mean the rumors are false either. Just... a little suspicious. There's just no way to know for sure as both Dylan and Victoria are unbelievably private about their lives on social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dylan has posted a couple of photos that feature women he may be linked to. One of them is of him in a diner with a beautiful young woman. But Dylan smartly keeps her a mystery. After all, some of the fan comments on the photo are a little overboard including one that simply reads "[She] better not be your girlfriend."</p><p>While fans are dying to know if he and Victoria are dating, there's just no concrete evidence to suggest that they are or that Dylan is seeing anyone.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Happened To Elizabeth Lail?
