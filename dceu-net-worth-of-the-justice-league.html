However, the general consensus seems to be that, much like&nbsp;Suicide Squad,&nbsp;producers and people running the show when comes to the DC Extended Universe need to come up with better scripts and better special effects.</p><p>Even thought he movie wasn't exactly extremely well received amongst audiences, one thing surely isn't to blame: the cast. All of them had great chemistry and there's no denying the actors and actresses came together to create a powerhouse of talent. Many of them were seasoned veterans of the industry, others just came into their fame. Let's take a look at how they're all doing when it comes to dollar signs.</p><h2 id=ray-fisher---500-000>Ray Fisher - $500,000</h2><p>When it comes to acting experience, Ray Fisher can be considered the baby of the group. It was a big gamble on DCEU's part to cast such an unknown and unexperienced actor ad Cyborg, but it did pay off in the end - there's no doubt Fisher's acting skills are way up there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Every Cast Member Of Vikings' Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Prior to his appearance on&nbsp;Justice League&nbsp;and&nbsp;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,&nbsp;Fisher only had two acting credits to his name. The short film&nbsp;The Good, the Bad, and the Confused.&nbsp;and a minor feature on television show&nbsp;The Astronaut Wives Club.&nbsp;He currently stars in&nbsp;<i>True Detective&nbsp;</i>and we can't wait to see what the future holds. So far so good, with a net worth of $500,000!</p><h2 id=ezra-miller---500-000>Ezra Miller - $500,000</h2><p>Lovable actor Ezra Miller was no stranger to the world of acting prior to being cast as The Flash. His first more recognisable gig was on&nbsp;Californication, but the full extent of his acting abilities wasn't perceived by the public up until his fantastic performance in&nbsp;We Need To Talk About Kevin.</p><p>After that, it was all the way up for Miller, being cast in blockbusters like&nbsp;The Perks Of Being A Wallflower,&nbsp;and both instalments of&nbsp;<i>Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them.&nbsp;</i>His current net worth is $500,000 but with his own stand-alone movie coming out soon, this number will definitely keep increasing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ciar-n-hinds---2-million>Ciarán Hinds - $2 Million</h2><p>The first seasoned veteran of the acting industry being featured on this list, and also the first&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;cast member. Irish actor Ciarán Hinds began his career in the late 70s, and he hasn't stopped since. From television series&nbsp;Rome&nbsp;to his appearance in the&nbsp;Harry Potter&nbsp;franchise, Hinds seems to always be around.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Richest Marvel Actors, Ranked</a></span></p><p>This time around, he played the role of the baddest guy around, and he's already been featured in a handful of other projects since&nbsp;Justice League&nbsp;came out. After so many years in the industry, it's no wonder he can brag about his $2 million net worth.</p><h2 id=gal-gadot---10-million>Gal Gadot - $10 Million</h2><p>Wonder Woman&nbsp;has been considered by many to be the best movie from the DC Extended Universe to have been released thus far. And Gal Gadot's performance as the title character has a lot to do with it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She's been acting since 2007, and had roles in two instalments of the&nbsp;Fast And Furious&nbsp;franchise. But it was her role as Wonder Woman that gave her the definite Hollywood starlet title. With the second movie already in post-production, and a handful of other film projects coming her way, Gal Gadot's $10 million net worth comes as no surprise.</p><h2 id=jason-momoa---14-million>Jason Momoa - $14 Million</h2><p>Many will remember him for his appearance on television series Baywatch, but the role that truly immortalised Jason Momoa as an acting powerhouse amongst fans was definitely that of Kal Drogo in&nbsp;Game of Thrones.&nbsp;With his jaw-dropping height and built, there was no one who could portray Aquaman quite like Momoa.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Expensive Mistakes Hollywood Has Ever Made</a></span></p><p>His first stand-alone movie already premiered, and the second one its on its way. Plus, Jason has a couple of other projects set aside beyond those in the DCEU. With a $14 million net worth already under his belt, fans can't wait to see what he's going to do next.</p><h2 id=jeremy-irons---16-million>Jeremy Irons - $16 Million</h2><p>Seasoned veteran number two is Jeremy Irons, and his role as Albert can actually be considered that of an unofficial member of the Justice League. Irons has already won an Oscar, and has a handful of other nominations he can brag about, all harnessed over the course of almost five decades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's almost impossible to decide exactly what role put Jeremy Irons on the map, but fifty years later, there's pretty much no need. Plus, he has a $16 million net worth - in our book, that's enough said.</p><h2 id=henry-cavill---20-million>Henry Cavill - $20 Million</h2><p>The British actor that managed to steal hearts around the world has been featured in a number of small parts in movies since the early 2000s. However, it was is recurrent role in period drama&nbsp;The Tudors&nbsp;that began shifting the tides for Henry Cavill.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Star Wars: Every Member Of The Dark Side's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>After being cast as all time favourite hero Superman, this man of steel is now considered a movie star in his own right. Aside from his starring role in&nbsp;The Man From U.N.C.L.E,&nbsp;he snatched a coveted role in&nbsp;Mission Impossible&nbsp;and a number of other projects. A $20 million net worth is what happens when you become a star!</p><h2 id=diane-lane---35-million>Diane Lane - $35 Million</h2><p>Oscar-nominated actress Diane Lane is nothing short of a Dame on her own right. Also a seasoned veteran of the industry, Lane had her first role in the movie A Little Romance&nbsp;back in 1979. From then on, she kept acting in several movies and television shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She can brag about the fact that she's one of Francis Ford Coppola's favourite actresses, having starred in four of his movies. And when it comes to money, she was already a multi-millionaire by the time she reached 18. Nothing seems to have changed, and as of today, Diane Lane has an astonishing net worth of $35 million.</p><h2 id=amy-adams---60-million>Amy Adams - $60 Million</h2><p>Beautiful and talented actress Amy Adams began her career in 1999, when she snatched her first movie role. She kept acting, and was featured in a large number of films and television shows, most notably,&nbsp;Enchanted. , The Wedding Date&nbsp;and&nbsp;Catch Me If You Can.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>DCEU: Net Worth Of The Suicide Squad</a></span></p><p>Her role in&nbsp;American Hustle&nbsp;cemented Adam's status as one of Hollywood's most talented actresses, along with six Oscar nominations. After&nbsp;Vice&nbsp;she has three more movies ready to come out of the oven, the sky is the limit for Amy Adams. We have a feeling $60 million isn't the number she'll carry attached to her net worth for long!</p><h2 id=ben-affleck---130-million>Ben Affleck - $130 Million</h2><p>This is a Hollywood powerhouse that doesn't need any sort of introduction. Actor, writer, producer, Ben Affleck can truly do it all. And that's exactly what he's been proving to audiences all around the world ever since he began acting in the early 80s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With two Oscars under his belt, he truly wasn't bothered by the public's reception of his portrayal of Batman. And even though Affleck announced he won't be reprising the role of the dark knight, he's got more than enough projects to keep him busy. Plus, with a staggering $130 million net worth, why&nbsp;worry about being Batman if you can be Ben Affleck?</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Highest-Grossing Quentin Tarantino Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8OcnK5lnprBbsPOq6uhZZ%2BberW0xGahrquknrCmecuemKCtlWQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdceu-net-worth-of-the-justice-league.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdceu-net-worth-of-the-justice-league.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdceu-net-worth-of-the-justice-league.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdceu-net-worth-of-the-justice-league.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdceu-net-worth-of-the-justice-league.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdceu-net-worth-of-the-justice-league.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nia-sioux-bio-facts-dancer-wiki-net-worth-affair-boyfriend-dating-age-height-family-movies-and-tv-shows-parents-career-measurements.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nia-sioux-bio-facts-dancer-wiki-net-worth-affair-boyfriend-dating-age-height-family-movies-and-tv-shows-parents-career-measurements.html>Nia Sioux Bio, Facts, Dancer, Wiki, Net Worth, Affair, Boyfriend, Dating, Age, Height, Family, M</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./michael-ciminos-house-located-in-east-hampton-lists-for-35-million.html>Michael Ciminos House Located In East Hampton Lists For $35 Million</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./michael-ciminos-house-located-in-east-hampton-lists-for-35-million.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
