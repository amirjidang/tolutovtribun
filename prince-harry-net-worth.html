He is the youngest son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, and is the sixth in the line of succession to the British throne. He was born in St Mary's Hospital, London. Harry attended Wetherby School, Ludgrove School, and then Elton College. He decided to go to Australia and Lesotho, then underwent officer training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. The Prince was commissioned as a cornet into the Blues and Royals, only serving temporarily with his brother, Prince William and eventually, he completed training as a troop leader. In 2007–2008, Harry served for over ten weeks in Helmand Province in Afghanistan. He went back to Afghanistan for a 20-week deployment in 2012–2013 with the Army Air Corps. He resigned from the army in 2015. Having lost his mother at only 12 years old, the Prince only sought counseling 20 years after her death and was honest to say it really caused him to struggle mentally in his 20's.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Around October 2016, it was reported the Prince had been dating Suits star Meghan Markle and in November 2016, he confirmed it. Meghan and Harry announced their plans to marry on November 27, 2018. He had proposed with a&nbsp;custom diamond engagement ring. Harry had designed the piece, then it was made by court jewelers, Cleave and Company, using a diamond from Botswana and two smaller stones from his mother, Princess Diana's collection. <a href=#>The engagement ring was worth $350 000</a>, with approximately 6 carats. Their wedding was on the 19th of May 2018 and <a href=#>was estimated&nbsp;to cost $42 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In early January 2020, the royal couple announced they would step back as senior members of the royal family. They also revealed their plan to become "financially independent," and no longer receive funding through the Sovereign Grant.&nbsp;After the couple left Kensington Palace, the two moved to Canada, where Meghan used to live as she filmed her USA Today TV series, Suits. From there, the couple relocated to Los Angeles before finding a home in Montecito, a neighborhood in Santa Barbara, California, where they live with their son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten Windsor.</p><p>While the royal family's net worth is in the tens of billions—$88 billion specifically, according to Forbes,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the portion that Prince Harry has personally</a> is much smaller. The young prince's income before he left the royal family was from his father, Prince Charles, and the Duch of Cornwall,&nbsp; who own a portfolio of property and financial investments that brought in £21.6 million (or $29.8 million) in 2019. From 2018 to 2018, Harry’s annual allowance from his father was $6.9 million. This paid for Harry and Meghan’s public duties as working members of the royal family, such as wardrobe, travel, and other private costs. Another part of Harry’s income came from the Sovereign Grant, which is paid by the government to the royal family to cover expenses for official duties, as well as the royal palace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Harry and Meghan became financially independent, it was estimated that Prince Harry was <strong>worth $40 million</strong>, accumulated from <a href=#>his inheritance</a> left in trust to him by his mother, Princess Diana. Harry can also expect an inheritance from his grandmother, the Queen Mother, that reportedly will include her jewels. Harry's former salary as a captain in the British Army was between $50,000 and $53,000 a year, according to Forbes.</p><p>Due to the&nbsp;public's fascination with Meghan and Harry’s life&nbsp;after leaving UK, in March 2021 the two were interviewed by Oprah Winfrey for CBS’ Oprah With Meghan and Harry: A CBS Primetime Special, however, it is said that the couple was not paid to speak out at all. Since leaving the royal life and moving to Hollywood they have signed numerous deals adding to their net worth as a couple. Us Weekly reports that Harry and Meghan signed a deal with the streaming service at the time for $100 million. The partnership is said to work with their production company to create documentaries, children’s programming, and docuseries. The deal allows them to focus on projects that Meghan and Harry care about personally. The music streaming giant Spotify also made a deal with the royal couple. The&nbsp;three-year&nbsp; Spotify deal with Prince Harry and Meghan is worth about $15 million to $18 million, according to sources. Their first podcast with Spotify came out in December 2020 and was worth $3.5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harry and Meghan allegedly signed a deal with Harry Walker Agency&nbsp;(Harry Walker also represents the Obama family.)&nbsp;in June 2020 for speaking engagements, charging $1 million per speech. Harry's main topics are mental health and grieving.&nbsp; Since they left the royals, Meghan and Harry have also worked with streaming services like<a href=#> AppleTV+</a>,&nbsp;Disney+, <a href=#>and Netflix</a> so they are steadily building their net worth.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>Forbes</a>, <a href=#>Style Caster</a>, <a href=#>Town and Country</a>&nbsp;, <a href=#>Marie Claire</a>, <a href=#>&nbsp;Brides</a>, <a href=#>The Knot</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earnings-amp-financial-data>Earnings & Financial Data</h2><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Date</p></th><th scope=col><p>Category</p></th><th scope=col><p>Description</p></th><th scope=col><p>Amount</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>2020</p></td><td><p>Event</p></td><td><p>Spotify Holiday Special</p></td><td><p>$3,500,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2020</p></td><td><p>Contract</p></td><td><p>Netflix</p></td><td><p>$100,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2020</p></td><td><p>Asset</p></td><td><p>House in Montecito, California</p></td><td><p>$14,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2020</p></td><td><p>Contract</p></td><td><p>Harry Walker Agency , 1 million per show</p></td><td><p>$1,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2020</p></td><td><p>Contract</p></td><td><p>Spotify Deal</p></td><td><p>$18,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2014</p></td><td><p>Misc.</p></td><td><p>Inheritance from his late mother</p></td><td><p>$10,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>Others</p></td><td><p>Annual investment Prince Harry and Prince William received as part of the $10 million which their mother left them</p></td><td><p>$450,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>Salary</p></td><td><p>Salary as Captain of the British Army</p></td><td><p>$60,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BvsdOwpqusmGS9sLjIraCcoZGjfLO72JqjaKiinruksYyhmKuqqWK7psCMsKarrJhk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprince-harry-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fprince-harry-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fprince-harry-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fprince-harry-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprince-harry-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harry-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./prince-harrys-spare-biggest-revelations-about-kate-middleton.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./prince-harrys-spare-biggest-revelations-about-kate-middleton.html>Prince Harry's 'Spare': Biggest Revelations About Kate Middleton</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./pregnant-fitness-blogger-with-six-pack-abs-responds-to-critics-w200931.html>Pregnant Fitness Blogger With Six-Pack Abs Responds to Critics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./pregnant-fitness-blogger-with-six-pack-abs-responds-to-critics-w200931.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
