After all, when a star athlete does something that seems impossible to the rest of us, that is captivating to see. For example, when Simone Biles became the first woman in history to pull off a Yurchenko double pike in a competition, even people who don’t usually care about gymnastics took notice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because of all the incredible things that she can do and <a href=#>the fascinating life that Simone Biles has led</a>, she has become rich and famous. Unlike a lot of celebrities, however, Biles has never come across as the kind of person who brags about their wealth. For that reason, a lot of Biles’ fans have been left wondering, how does Simone spend her incredible net worth?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Does Simone Biles Train And Stay In Shape?</a></span></p><h2 id=simone-biles-rsquo-unique-celebrity-stance-on-money>Simone Biles’ Unique Celebrity Stance On Money</h2><p>Most of the time when somebody initially becomes rich and famous, there is one thing they tend to do, <a href=#>spend their first big paycheque on something crazy</a>. Of course, that is understandable since most people would do something similar if they were in the same position. However, there have been far too many stars who’ve spent money like there is was no tomorrow throughout their time on top and gone broke once their careers slowed down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since many people consider Simone Biles to be the greatest gymnast in history, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that she has amassed an impressive $10 million fortune as of the time of this writing. With that in mind, it is clear that Biles has enough money that she can afford to throw it around to a certain degree. While this article will reveal some of the things that Biles has spent a lot of money on, it is interesting to learn that she has a unique attitude about money among her celebrity peers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During a 2019 appearance on the Kneading Dough podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Simone Biles explained that she “has a fear of going broke”</a>. As a result, Biles says she hates lowering her bank account and she even challenges herself to go days without spending money, “and then, of course, my gas light come on so I have to go get gas.” Later in that interview, Biles explained that she “will only splurge if [she] earned it” by performing well in a major competition.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>19 NHL Stars Who Lost Everything: Where Are They Now?</a></span></p><h2 id=simone-biles-rsquo-incredible-home>Simone Biles’ Incredible Home</h2><p>Throughout Simone Bile’s gymnastics career, she has traveled the world to compete with the top athletes from every country. While that seems incredibly glamorous from the outside looking in, and it is to a certain degree, it also isn’t all that it is cracked up to be. For proof of that fact, all you have to do is look at <a href=#>the backlash Biles received in some corners after largely pulling out of the Olympics</a>. After all, if most people felt unsafe at work, either mentally, physically, or both, and they protected themselves, they wouldn’t have to deal with haters from all over the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the bright side, Simone Biles has rightfully received a lot of support and when she wants to escape the haters, she has a wonderful home she can enjoy away from the prying eye of the public. Located in Houston, Texas, Biles’ 4,000-square-foot home seems to be perfect for the superstar athlete. Boasting four bedrooms and three-and-a-half bathrooms, Biles has ample room to move around in her home. Also highlighted by high ceilings, a cozy fireplace, high-end appliances, and quartz countertops, every glimpse Biles has given the world of her home makes it seem gorgeous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to property records, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Simone Biles bought her home for $750,000</a> which is far less than the amount most celebrities pay for their mansions. That said, once Biles owned the property, she paid to have a pool and a dog wash station installed. Even with that in mind, those renovations couldn’t have added that much to the overall cost of Biles’ home.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Celebs Own The 10 Most Expensive Houses In Hollywood?</a></span></p><h2 id=simone-bile-rsquo-s-beloved-car>Simone Bile’s Beloved Car</h2><p>In the celebrity ecosystem, there are loads of stars who have spent a fortune to accumulate massive car collections. For example, it is no secret that the comedians and friends Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld both have car collections that would leave some billionaires blushing. While Simone Biles certainly can’t compete with stars like those, she definitely isn’t driving around in a used clunker car either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In late 2020, Simone Biles posted an image of her new ride on her Instagram stories. As some eagle-eyed car enthusiasts quickly figured out, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biles had become the owner of a new convertible Range Rover Evoque</a>. Judging by the smile on Biles’ face in the photo she posted of the car, she seems very happy with her purchase even though she has spoken about hating to spend money.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>From TikTok To "TMI," Social Media Handstand Challenge Has Gymnast Simone Biles Flashing Her Fans</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqoqWfo7JursilnKxlnprBbsPOq6uhZZekwW6%2ByJyfZqqVlrlusdKtmK2dXai9prrDoqWgZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsimone-biles-net-worth-got-rich-real-estate-spending.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsimone-biles-net-worth-got-rich-real-estate-spending.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsimone-biles-net-worth-got-rich-real-estate-spending.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsimone-biles-net-worth-got-rich-real-estate-spending.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsimone-biles-net-worth-got-rich-real-estate-spending.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsimone-biles-net-worth-got-rich-real-estate-spending.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-sanaa-lathan-lesbian-age-height-net-worth-464779-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-sanaa-lathan-lesbian-age-height-net-worth-464779-html.html>Is Sanaa Lathan Lesbian?
