The couple wed in 2019 and have a 2-year-old daughter, Lyra.&nbsp;</p><p>Sheeran’s close friend, Jamal Edwards, was a British entrepreneur who gave Sheeran his big break through his media company, SBTV.&nbsp;</p><p>Edwards died at age 31 after a sudden illness in February 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Sheeran found himself standing in court defending his integrity and career as a songwriter over a lawsuit alleging he plagiarized “Shape of You” from an artist named Sami Switch. Sheeran won the case in April 2022.</p><p>“Subtract” is set to be released on May 5, following a series of other mathematic-themed albums from Sheeran, including “Plus,” “Multiply,” “Divide,” and “Equals.”&nbsp;</p><p>For the first time, Sheeran is not trying to craft an album that people will like but is merely putting something out that is honest and true to where he is in his adult life.&nbsp;</p><p>He hopes that his fans will appreciate the honesty and that the album will resonate with those who have been through difficult times.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCxw2aqoZ2Vp66vv4ywoJ%2Bdo2K1pq3LrZ9mraCZrrWxjK2spqeiYrGqrcanpqyho2Kxtr7Ip55mqKKatK%2BtzZywaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fed-sheerans-wifes-health-update-tumor-diagnosis-during-pregnancy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fed-sheerans-wifes-health-update-tumor-diagnosis-during-pregnancy.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fed-sheerans-wifes-health-update-tumor-diagnosis-during-pregnancy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fed-sheerans-wifes-health-update-tumor-diagnosis-during-pregnancy.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fed-sheerans-wifes-health-update-tumor-diagnosis-during-pregnancy.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fed-sheerans-wifes-health-update-tumor-diagnosis-during-pregnancy.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./everything-you-need-to-know-about-jason-clarke-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./everything-you-need-to-know-about-jason-clarke-biography.html>Everything You Need To Know About Jason Clarke Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./diego-boneta-parents-meet-astrid-boneta-lauro-gonzalez.html>Diego Boneta Parents: Meet Astrid Boneta &amp;amp; Lauro Gonzalez</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./diego-boneta-parents-meet-astrid-boneta-lauro-gonzalez.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
