For over six months, the reality star avoided the paparazzi and slowly but surely disappeared from the Internet, fuelling the baby buzz. And alas, baby Stormi Webster is here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though we officially know the name and gender of Kylie’s baby, the drama surrounding her pregnancy sure hasn’t died down. Specifically, fans are still curious to know who is the real father of Stormi. Kylie has remained&nbsp;silent on the subject of Stormi’s paternity since the rumours started flying. She only began dating her current BF, Travis Scott, a month after separating from her beau of 3-years, Tyga. Thus, tons of fans have been wondering if there’s a chance that Stormi is Tyga’s.</p><p>Given that Kylie gave Stormi Travis’ last name (it’s actually Webster- Scott is his stage name), many fans have resolved that he must be her baby daddy. But there are some of us who still aren’t convinced that Travis is the daddy. Check out these signs that prove Stormi’s dad might be someone else (hint: Tyga). Who do you think is Kylie’s baby daddy?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stormi-doesn-t-look-like-travis><strong>Stormi Doesn’t Look Like&nbsp;Travis</strong></h2><p>So far, Kylie has only released one official picture of her baby girl. But it didn’t take long for fans to begin pointing out that Stormi doesn’t look a lot like her dad. Some fans accused Stormi of looking too light skinned in the pic Kylie posted to her Instagram, which showed the baby’s hand wrapped around her own. It sounds like some fans expected Stormi to have darker features.</p><p><strong>“She definitely can’t be Travis baby,” one fan commented on the pic. “This ain’t a black guys’ kid,” another one of Kylie’s followers wrote.</strong></p><p>However, some fans argued against this, saying that of course Stormi wouldn't have her dad's exact skin tone since she's biracial. Others said that it’s hard to tell what Stormi looks like at all based on one photograph. Still, there remain a legion of fans who are convinced that Stormi looks nothing like Travis, and thus she mustn’t be his daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-ex-bf-tyga-thinks-it-s-his><strong>Her Ex BF Tyga&nbsp;Thinks It’s His</strong></h2><p>The whole world is aware of the weird love triangle that led up to Kylie getting pregnant. This time last year, Kylie was still with her long-time boyfriend Tyga. But within a month of the couple officially calling it quits in April, Kylie was already photographed romancing Travis. Media outlets say there would have been less than a one month window that Kylie waited before getting with her new boyfriend.</p><p>Thus, tons of people think it’s plausible baby Stormi could be Tyga’s… including him! When the pregnancy rumours first broke, Tyga posted (then quickly deleted) a Snapchat that said, “Nah that's my kid.” Many fans took this as Tyga insinuating that he was actually Kylie’s baby daddy. Since then, the rapper has been pretty quiet on social media about Kylie’s pregnancy, which must mean he’s given up hope that Stormi is his… right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tyga-is-demanding-a-dna-test><strong>Tyga Is Demanding A DNA Test</strong></h2><p>Though Tyga hasn’t spoken out publicly about Kylie or baby Stormi, sources say that the rapper has already begun demanding a DNA test. It sounds like he still isn’t convinced that Travis is the baby’s father, despite Kylie giving her daughter Travis’ last name.</p><p><strong>“Tyga wants a DNA test because he really thinks that there is a chance this baby could be his,” an <a href=#>insider</a> told Radar Online.</strong></p><p>“Tyga told friends that he was still active with Kylie nine months ago, when this baby was likely conceived,' the source revealed,” they went on, adding that Tyga “wants to meet the baby.”&nbsp;“He has a lot of questions and most importantly he still wonders if there is a chance if that baby could be his,” the source continued. “Tyga misses Kylie now more than ever, really wants to meet the baby and wants some clarity and or closure on their situation […] [He] wants to know for sure so he can man-up and be a good father, or try to move on once and for all.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tyga-and-kylie-still-talk-and-travis-is-worried><strong>Tyga And Kylie Still Talk And Travis Is Worried</strong></h2><p>What with them becoming new parents and all, you’d think Kylie and Travis would be focusing all their energy on themselves and their new baby. But sources say that Tyga is still finding a way to wean himself in their relationship. Kylie has reportedly been in contact with her ex since delivering Stormi, and Travis is threatened by it. Could that be because he thinks there’s a chance Stormi is his baby?</p><p><strong>"[Tyga] told her that he was happy for her as he knew this was something she has always wanted,” a <a href=#>source</a> told Hollywood Life.</strong></p><p>“Tyga also told Kylie that he knew she was going to be an amazing mother. It was short, sweet and included that he misses her and hopes he gets to meet the baby." They went on, “Travis was furious by the message from her ex.” Interestingly, the source said that Kylie defended it, saying “[Tyga] and I will always, always have a bond.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-is-known-to-play-head-games><strong>Kylie Is Known To Play Head Games</strong></h2><p>We doubt it would be easy dating any KarJenner, but Kylie seems like an especially hard girlfriend to please. Sources have said that Kylie loves toying her boyfriends around, which has got fans questioning if this pregnancy is no different.</p><p><strong>“Tyga thinks Kylie is a manipulator and player — and says that if he was to summon up any kind of feeling for Travis, it would be one of pity,”</strong></p><p>That is what a source <a href=#>said</a> following the Travis-Kylie-Tyga love triangle. “Tyga‘s been telling people that he thinks he had a lucky escape, and he’s thankful that he hasn’t got to be tied to the Kardashians for the rest of his life.”&nbsp;If it’s true that Kylie is a huge manipulator, then it’s not far fetched to question whether she’s lying about the paternity of baby Stormi. Hmmm…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kris-may-have-orchestrated-the-whole-thing><strong>Kris May Have Orchestrated The Whole Thing</strong></h2><p>Kris Jenner has devoted her life to building the careers of her children. It’s a widely known fact that the Momager was never the biggest fan of Kylie’s first love, Tyga. That’s why some fans think the matriarch actually encouraged Kylie to lie about her baby’s paternity in order to secure a ‘better’ baby daddy for her daughter.</p><p>Back in 2015, a source told People magazine that Kris was “worried” about Kylie and Tyga’s relationship.</p><p><strong>“A lot of Tyga's friends are enablers,” they <a href=#>said</a>. “That makes her mom the most nervous. She doesn't want Kylie getting off track.”</strong></p><p>Seriously, some fans think that Kris would go so low as to lie to the entire world about Stormi’s dad, and actually keep her granddaughter’s father away from her. She must really hate Tyga! We’re not entirely convinced by this theory, but we’ll admit that there’s a lot that Kris would do for money and to protect her family’s name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-and-travis-haven-t-moved-in><strong>Kylie And Travis Haven’t Moved In</strong></h2><p>Sources claim that Kylie and Travis have been over the moon since discovering her pregnancy- so why hasn’t he moved in? Rumour has it that the young couple are taking things slowly despite being parents. Given that they were together less than a month before getting pregnant, this might not be a bad idea. But some fans are taking this as a sign that Travis isn’t completely convinced Stormi is his.</p><p>“Kylie and Travis are not officially living together,” a source <a href=#>told</a> People magazine this month, adding that the two are in no rush to take their relationship to the next level. “He has his own place. They are co-parenting though, and things are going great. They are together and happy.” They went on, “They’re not in rush. They’re just enjoying their little family.”</p><h2 id=travis-is-nowhere-on-her-instagram><strong>Travis Is Nowhere On Her Instagram</strong></h2><p>Kylie is the Queen of social media. She documents her entire life for her millions of followers to see, including all the TMI moments. Back when she was dating Tyga, Kylie would often post cute Snapchat videos of them or sexy pics of them to her Instagram. So why hasn’t she done that for Travis?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Save for Stormi’s announcement video, there’s been no trace of Travis on Kylie’s Instagram. We’re talking like not at all, even before Ky got pregnant and went on social media hiatus. We find it hard to believe that Kylie wouldn’t want to show off her baby daddy, especially since she’s been so public with her romantic life before. Some fans think this is a sign that Travis really isn’t her baby daddy; do you?</p><h2 id=kylie-might-be-thinking-of-breaking-it-up><strong>Kylie Might Be Thinking Of Breaking It Up</strong></h2><p>Given that she just became a young mom, the last thing we’d think would be on Kylie’s mind is the idea of breaking up. But sources have said that Kylie isn’t sure if her relationship with Travis is going to work out… though she might be the one to blame.</p><p><strong>The reality star is reportedly still playing the same sort of love games she did before welcoming Stormi, and Travis is getting sick of it.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Kylie loves Tyga’s new album and all the attention she’s getting,” an insider recently <a href=#>dished</a> to Hollywood Life, referencing Kylie’s ex Tyga, who’s notorious for rapping about her on his albums. “Especially because it’s really keeping Travis on his toes. It’s clear to the whole world now how much Tyga wants her back and Travis has taken notice in a big way. The competition is good for Travis and their relationship in general. Travis knows if he doesn’t keep Kylie happy Tyga is right there waiting to swoop in.”</p><h2 id=rob-and-chyna-have-something-to-do-with-it><strong>Rob And Chyna Have Something To Do With It</strong></h2><p>Did the ickiness of the whole Rob and Chyna situation finally get to Kylie?</p><p>For those who don’t know, Tyga left his baby mama and ex fiancée, Blac Chyna, when he decided to begin dating Kylie. Since then, Chyna has seemingly been out to get the KarJenner family as a whole. But things climaxed when Chyna began dating Kylie’s half brother Rob and got pregnant within a few months (isn’t this family fertile?!).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that everybody except Rob could see that she was only using him to get back at his famous family. Things climaxed when the two broke up shortly after their daughter’s birth, and Chyna went on to sue the entire Kardashian-Jenner Klan. One wild theory floating around on the Internet is that Kylie is lying about Tyga not being Stormi’s dad, so she could save her baby from being involved in this complicated mess. It may be far fetched, but it’s still believable.</p><h2 id=kylie-might-have-gone-behind-travis-back><strong>Kylie Might Have Gone Behind Travis' Back</strong></h2><p>Being unfaithful to your baby daddy isn’t a very good source of commitment. Some so-called insiders claimed that Kylie was being unfaithful behind Travis’ back during her pregnancy- this makes us question whether he’s really the baby daddy or if she was keeping the real guy hidden and off to the side?&nbsp;Said a source <a href=#>said</a> when Kylie was several months pregnant:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“Travis has been spending more time with Kylie the past few weeks. He’s got some downtime and he’s finally making her a priority,” &nbsp;</strong></p><p>They went on, “But he’s still not as present as Kylie would like. When he’s at her place he’s always on his phone, he’s very distracted and that gets Kylie upset. When she’s upset with Travis that’s when she starts texting with Tyga. Travis would be shocked if he knew how much she’s in contact with Tyga lately. Anytime she’s mad at Travis she texts Tyga. There have been times she’s been messaging back and forth with Tyga while Travis is in the other room.”</p><h2 id=she-really-was-kim-s-surrogate><strong>She Really Was Kim’s Surrogate</strong></h2><p>When the pregnancy rumours first began, some fans suggested that Kylie could be acting as older sis Kim’s surrogate. But most people have put this theory to rest given that we’ve seen photos of both Chicago West and Stormi Webster, meaning they are in fact two separate people. However, what if there’s more to the story?&nbsp;There’s a crazy theory (and when I say crazy, I mean absolutely bonkers) that says,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Kylie might have started out as Kim’s surrogate, but then decided to keep the baby for herself.</strong></p><p>And, then, we guess Kim hired someone outside of the family to carry their third child. Weird, huh?&nbsp;It seems hard to believe that Kylie would be raising her sister and brother-in-law’s baby as her own, especially if she originally agreed to be the surrogate. And given that Kim’s third child is older than Stormi, that would mean the surrogate got pregnant before Kylie, which doesn’t really help support this theory. This theory is probably untrue, but it sure is wild!</p><h2 id=tyga-and-kylie-had-valentines-day-plans><strong>Tyga And Kylie Had Valentines Day Plans</strong></h2><p>Stormi was born at the beginning of February, so hardly over two weeks ago. But it sounds like that didn’t stop Kylie from having a romantic Valentine’s Day… and not with who you’re thinking. Days before the date, a source claimed that Tyga was planning to go all out and surprise Kylie with the Valentines of her dreams. That doesn’t sound like something you’d do for someone who wasn’t your baby mama.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Tyga is sure there was overlap and he still thinks the baby could be his,” an insider <a href=#>told</a> Hollywood Life. “Tyga isn’t done taunting Travis. He plans to send Kylie flowers for Valentine’s Day — red roses mixed with baby pink to represent baby Stormi. He’s already put in the order. Travis is going to freak when he finds out.” They went on, “Tyga knows that Travis wants him nowhere near Kylie or her new baby, but he doesn’t care. He feels more than entitled to go after Kylie. He feels like Travis stole his girl, so Kylie is fair game.”</p><h2 id=kylie-is-tying-to-make-tyga-jealous><strong>Kylie Is Tying To Make Tyga Jealous</strong></h2><p>To say things moved past between Travis and Kylie would be an understatement. They became young parents less than a year after meeting each other, and all in the public’s eye.</p><p><strong>“Kylie had a lot of trust issues with Tyga,” an insider <a href=#>explained</a>. “He was her first love and she was obsessed with him, but she never felt like she could trust him 100 percent. With Travis, things got really serious fast, even though she was still getting over Tyga.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some fans remain convinced that the reality star is still in love with her ex, Tyga. Sources have previously said that Kylie wasn’t completely over Tyga when she started hooking up with Travis. It’s not far fetched to think that she’s only sticking with Travis to make her ex jealous, not because he’s in fact the father of her baby.&nbsp;It would be a whole new low if Kylie knows that Tyga is the dad, but is just holding out on him because of a grudge. But young love dies hard!</p><h2 id=kylie-and-travis-weren-t-always-exclusive><strong>Kylie And Travis&nbsp;Weren’t Always Exclusive</strong></h2><p>Remember that Kylie and Travis would have dated for only about a month before she got pregnant. The two hadn’t even made their relationship red carpet official when they learned they were going to be parents. And that means we have to question whether they were even exclusive or not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given how little they had dated before things got serious, it’s not far fetched to assume the two had been seeing other people when they first began dating. Many people (including Tyga himself) maintain that Kylie was hooking up with different people right after she broke up with Tyga, including her ex. Likewise, it’s safe to assume that Travis probably wasn’t only dating Kylie when they first began seeing each other. Thus, it seems plausible that Stormi’s dad could be someone other than the rapper!</p><h2 id=kylie-thinks-travis-is-a-better-dad-than-tyga><strong>Kylie Thinks Travis Is A Better Dad Than Tyga</strong></h2><p>Tyga already had a son, King Cairo, with Blac Chyna before he began dating Kylie. But that evidently wasn’t enough to convince the makeup mogul that he’d make a good dad. Some fans have expressed their belief that Kylie is claiming Travis is the dad because she thinks he’ll make a better dad then Tyga. Um, since when was doing something like that okay?!</p><p>Sources say that Kylie feels her relationship with Travis is healthier, so maybe there is some truth to this wild fan theory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“[Travis] is very protective of Kylie, and his family embraced her, too,” one source <a href=#>told</a> People magazine.</strong></p><p>“Kylie has matured a lot since becoming pregnant and is much less dramatic than when she was with Tyga.” They added, “He was shocked when she got pregnant, but Travis was very supportive from the beginning and was there every step of the way.”</p><h2 id=her-social-media-hiatus-was-part-of-the-plan><strong>Her Social Media Hiatus Was Part Of The Plan</strong></h2><p>Kylie claims that she wanted the utmost privacy during her pregnancy, which is why she chose to disappear from social media without even announcing her good news. But could there be another reason for her social media hiatus?</p><p>Some fans have put forward the theory that maybe she was giving fans time to get used to the idea of her and Travis, so there’d be less focus on her paternity scandal ft. Tyga. If we didn’t know what was going on in her life for those 6+ months where she disappeared from the Internet, then who are we to say whether or not she and Travis are the real deal?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Honestly, it seems like the most plausible reason for her break from the Internet was because she really did want to take time off during her pregnancy (or was insecure about her preggo bod, as another theory suggests). But, who knows, maybe it did have something to do with the identity of Stormi’s dad.</p><h2 id=travis-won-t-stay-faithful-to-her><strong>Travis Won’t Stay Faithful To Her</strong></h2><p>We’re beginning to think that even Travis is unsure about Stormi’s paternity. Throughout Kylie’s pregnancy, sources said that the rapper had a hard time committing and settling down with the makeup mogul. He’s evidently been worried that she has cheated on him in the past, which has made it tough for him to give up his partying ways.</p><p>“Kylie and Travis got into a blowout fight after he showed up unexpectedly to her mother Kris' house, where she’s been staying lately. She flipped out on him and accused him of cheating on her with several women during her pregnancy, including a girl that she is kinda friends with,” a source told Radar Online about an incident during Kylie’s pregnancy. Does that sound like something you’d be doing to your baby mama?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tyga-has-never-believed-travis-is-the-dad><strong>Tyga Has Never Believed&nbsp;Travis Is The Dad</strong></h2><p>Since the pregnancy rumours began, sources have remained adamant that Tyga is convinced the baby is his. He claims the timeline of Stormi’s conception proves she could be his, and he’s convinced that he’s the only guy Kylie will ever have a baby with. Those are some bold claims!</p><p>But the fact that Kylie’s ex won’t let go of the fact that Travis might not be her baby daddy means we shouldn’t either.</p><p><strong>“It’s still not real to him that Kylie is pregnant. It will actually become a reality when he sees pictures of her with her child and he is not looking forward to that day,” an insider <a href=#>explained</a>.</strong></p><p>They continued, “It is a weird set of emotions right now for Tyga and when the birth happens, that is when things are going to hit its peak and the most he’ll be upset. It’s basically what could have been when he thinks of her now.”</p><h2 id=kylie-is-competing-with-her-sisters><strong>Kylie Is Competing With Her Sisters</strong></h2><p>Is there anything the Kardashian-Jenner sisters don’t compete about?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For years, sources have said that Kylie is racing to build her empire to compete with her sisters. But (up until now, that is) Kylie was one of the only sisters left to not have started a family. Though Kylie’s pregnancy was reportedly unplanned, some fans think the reality star actually did orchestrate the whole thing so she could become a mom, like her older sisters.</p><p>Though she only became a mom a few weeks ago, sources say the makeup mogul is already thinking about baby #2! “She clearly is still learning about being a new mom, but she would definitely be interested in having another kid in like two years,” an insider <a href=#>told</a> Hollywood Life.
