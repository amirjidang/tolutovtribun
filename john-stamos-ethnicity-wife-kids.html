He grew up in a modest family with his 2 younger siblings. John Stamos hails from a mixed ethnic background of Greek, English, Irish, German and a bit of Jewish-Russian mix. As a young boy, he worked in his family food business (restaurant) in Orange County.</p><p>John Stamos was but a boy of 4 when his interest in music piqued, he was enrolled into a class where he was taught how to play drums and he later formed his own band called ‘Destiny’, they played in parties, amusement parks, and concerts. He later in 1994 released his first album titled ‘Shades of Blue’, the album was subsequently released on iTunes. He worked with Gary Griffin, Tony Guerrero, David Enos, Lanny Cordola among others.</p><p>The actor was educated at John F. Kennedy High School where he started honing his musical skills. At the age of 15, the lad was a part of an all-boys band where he played drums and vocals for them during tours and concerts. After high school, John was admitted to Cypress College but dropped out in just a semester to focus on building his career as an actor with his parent’s blessings.
