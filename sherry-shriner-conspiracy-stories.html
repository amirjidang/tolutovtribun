Is it true that she had a hand in the 2017 death of Steven Mineo? What is the truth behind the story? Let’s find out.</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brief Introduction About Sherry Shriner’s Life</h2><p>Sherry Shriner was born in 1975 in the United States of America, and she was the leader of an alien reptilian cult.</p><p>In 2021, she took her last breath, and many news channels and websites have reported that her death was directly connected with Steven Mineo’s death, which occurred four years back.</p><p>The recent documentary made the people of the country more curious about Sherry Shiner. Many questions arose in 2017 at the death of Mineo, who was sherry’s online follower and was murdered by his girlfriend.</p><p>It is reported that before the death of Mineo, he had a troubling <a href=#>relationship</a> with his girlfriend because of the leader of the reptilian cult.</p><p>Sherry Shriner self-ordained herself as ‘<strong>Messenger of the Highest God.’ </strong>She started her group on Facebook and used to share her beliefs and prophecies & made many followers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sherry Shriner Claims On Prophecy</h2><p>Since her conspiracies, many people started suspecting Shriner and considered her a fraud.</p><p>After hearing rumors across the country, she came to the media and everted people’s claims against her.</p><p>In one of the interviews, she said: <strong>“People call me a false prophet. Out of every four humans, only one is real … we are at critical mass.”</strong></p><p>In the series – The Devil You Know, it was shown that Mineo was not the first person to force his girlfriend to kill him and was brainwashed by his cult leader.</p><p>The self-described “Messenger of the Highest God” had manipulated many of her followers and even turned them against each other.</p><p>This was the only reason that Mineo had a troubled relationship with his girlfriend, and they began to fight each other the day came when he forced his girlfriend to kill him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Story Behind Barbara Rogers’ Killing Of Her Boyfriend – Steven Mineo</h2><p>Steven Mineo and Barbara Rogers were the members of Sherry Shriner, and they were satisfied with her.</p><p>All things were running smooth, but the problem came when Rogers uploaded a trivial Facebook post about enjoying raw meat, and Shriner began promoting her as an inhumane and said:</p><p><strong>“There are only certain types of people who crave the raw meat because they crave blood, Those with the vampire demon in them.”</strong></p><p>Since then, Mineo began suspecting Shriner of the fraud she had done before and uploaded five videos between May 29 and July 1, 2017, so that he could expose Shriner in front of everyone, and he realized the shrine’s false prophethood.</p><p>Shriner and her loyalists’ followers started a campaign against Rogers&nbsp; and labialized her <strong>“Vampire Witch Reptilian Super Soldier.”</strong></p><p>In one of the statements released by Roger said: <strong>“Me and Mineo had recently become upset with the leader of the cult, who believed that Rogers was actually a reptile.”</strong></p><p>On the other hand, Musmanno wrote:<strong> “Rogers’s and Mineo’s issues with the cult had caused tension in their relationship. Rogers also stated that she killed Mineo because Mineo wanted her to kill him, and that she was under a large amount of stress due to the issues with the cult.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The couple went to a local bar and drank until 2 a.m. Before returning to their apartments, they hit the road to the forest. Mineo forced his girlfriend to shoot him in the head in the forest.</p><p>At 2:25, the Pocono Mountain Regional Police arrived with officers and found a 45-caliber Glock near Mineo’s body and a hole in his forehead.&nbsp;</p><p>Rogers was arrested and taken to the Monroe County jail, and Rogers said that Mineo had forced her to press the trigger.</p><p>She said:<strong> “I admitted to shooting Mineo at his request, and I had no idea that the gun was loaded.”</strong></p><p>Regardless of her intention of not shooting her boyfriend, Roger was offered a guilty plea deal for third-degree murder and was sentenced to more than ten years.</p><p>After the death of Mineo, Sherry Shriner uploaded and wrote on Facebook: “Morphed her huge teeth out.”</p><p>She further said: <strong>“Mineo hated me because I warned him she would destroy him, and she did. He just couldn’t believe she would do that.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Was Sherry Shriner’s Net Worth At Death?</h2><p>Sherry had an estimated net worth of around USD 2.5 million at the time of death, which she acquired from her profession after leading a reptilian cult.</p><p>According to Forbes magazine’s annual list, Sherry comes among the most powerful people.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Caused Sherry Shriner’s Death?</h2><p>Many conspiracies emerged during the claim of Shrines’ prophecy, and some of the conspiracies proved her to be a wrong and mere fraud.</p><p>She took her breath in January 2021 and died from a coronary heart assault, and at death she was 56 years.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2Fx56pq7FdqLWztc2eqWabn6PAsbXRmpqyZaOpvLO1xKxm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsherry-shriner-conspiracy-stories.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsherry-shriner-conspiracy-stories.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsherry-shriner-conspiracy-stories.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsherry-shriner-conspiracy-stories.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsherry-shriner-conspiracy-stories.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsherry-shriner-conspiracy-stories.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-stephanie-serikstad-gertrude-baniszewski-daughter-now-age-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-stephanie-serikstad-gertrude-baniszewski-daughter-now-age-wiki.html>Who Is Stephanie Serikstad?
