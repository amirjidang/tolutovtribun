So how much is Cox’s net worth today and how has she been making her money since OITNB ended? Here’s the lowdown…</p><h2 id=laverne-cox-s-net-worth>Laverne Cox’s Net Worth</h2><p><strong>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Cox is worth an impressive $4 million, with most of her fortune coming from her success on Netflix.</strong></p><p>It’s rumored that Cox was making less than $30,000 per episode before she would return for a third series, which supposedly saw her salary bumped to $60,000 per episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrities Who Canceled Themselves With One Social Media Post</a></span></p><p>By season 3, Netflix clearly knew they had a hit show on their hands, so doubling on the salaries of its lead stars came as no surprise.</p><p>While Cox had already appeared in a series of shows before OITNB, she admitted in an interview with Women’s Health&nbsp;magazine that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the pay was never enough for her to consider acting a full-time job</a>. In fact, things were so bad that she often found herself having very little money left after paying her bills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Just a few years ago, I was still struggling to pay my rent,” she said. “I was thinking of going back to graduate school [for women's studies] actually because I hadn’t had an acting role for nine months. All the success just reminds me of how far I have come and how much work is still yet to be done.”</p><p>And what a turnout she has made because since landing her career breakout in 2013, Cox has never stopped working.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s What Lauren Lapkus From ‘Orange Is The New Black’ Is Doing Now</a></span></p><p>In 2017, she starred in the CBS series Doubt alongside Katherine Heigl and Dule Hill, and while the show seemed very promising, the network decided not to renew it for a second series.</p><p>Still, Cox would have made a significant amount just for being cast in a syndicated television series — on top of being a recurring cast member on one of the hottest shows on Netflix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking about what had made her want to take on the role of playing a lawyer on the show, the LGBTQ+ activist told Variety in 2017, “I’ve always wanted to play a lawyer, but when&nbsp;I was approached with this script I saw that Joan&nbsp;Rater and Tony Phalen&nbsp;had written this script, I was a huge fan of their work on Grey’s Anatomy."</p><p>“They did such an amazing job of writing these characters that were iconic. The years that they were on ‘Grey’s,’ the show was at the height&nbsp;of McDreamy, McSteamy, the Snow Patrol song, “Choose me” — all those moments that they created were so incredible.</p><p>She concluded, “So getting to work with show-runners of that caliber was the big draw. But I’ve really wanted to play a lawyer&nbsp;and do something different. The opportunity to be on network television, too, was really exciting to me. Netflix is awesome, Netflix has changed the world. But it’s a change to have a broadcast&nbsp;audience and have a different experience.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Has Taylor Schilling Been Up To Since ‘Orange Is The New Black’?</a></span></p><p>Cox also had a recurring role playing Cousin Sheena in The Mindy Project before landing her biggest part in a blockbuster flick after being cast in the 2019 Charlie’s Angels reboot.</p><p>She’s currently filming her next TV series titled Inventing Anna before she commences work on the comedy show Clean Slate with actor George Wallace.</p><p>Cox is also a best-selling author, who published her brutally honest book, Daring to Be Myself: A Memoir, back in 2015.</p><p>In May 2021, it was announced that the actress had signed a deal with the E! network that will see her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">take over Giuliana Rancic’s position as host of Live From E!</a></p><p>"Laverne Cox is a risktaker, groundbreaking pioneer, and a fashion tour de force,"&nbsp;executive vice president of E!
