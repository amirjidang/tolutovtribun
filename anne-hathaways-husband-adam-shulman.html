The actress is known for her roles in The Devil Wears Prada and The Princess Diaries.</p><p>Happily married since 2012, Anne Hathaway knew, at first sight, she was going to marry her husband. Anne Hathaway’s husband is Adam Shulman, and the two have been happily married for a decade.&nbsp;</p><p>If not on movie sets filming her next blockbuster, Anne Hathaway would be found in her home with her husband. The Princess Diaries’ actor told a friend she was going to marry Adam the instant she set her eyes on him.</p><p>“I knew from the second I met him that he was the love of my life,” Anne Hathaway revealed and reminisced years later in an interview she gave to Harper’s BAZAAR UK. The famed actor values privacy when it comes to her innate feelings, but couldn’t hold back.</p><p>The actor is an Oscar winner and celebrated in her industry as a gifted and talented actor.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people know that Shakespeare’s wife was also named Anne Hathaway, and they can’t stop comparing the names. Since many people also don’t know much about Anne Hathaway’s husband as well, they ponder whether he is a reincarnation of the author or not.</p><p>But who is Anne Hathaway’s husband, Adam Shulman?</p><p>Adam Shalman is an actor and a producer along with being a jewelry designer. He has appeared in notable films and TV series. The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning and American Dreams are names that most people know him by.</p><p>He was born on 2nd April 2981. His interests have taken him to other ventures, where he likes to design jewelry. He co-owns a brand called James Banks Design which specializes in handmade jewelry. Its website places it in Northern California.</p><p>The website also tells us that the company’s portfolio has a range of designs such as butterfly pendants, constellation baubles, feather details, and much more. He certainly is a gifted designer and a businessman.&nbsp;</p><p>The actor’s fairytale began when they both met in 2008 at a film festival. Mutual friends brought them together and as the actor proclaimed she was going to marry Adam, that happened a few years later.</p><p>The year 2011 saw Anne Hathaway’s husband proposing a 6-carat diamond ring he designed himself. The proposal happened in November and by September 2012, the couple got married in Big Sur, California, in a private ceremony with 150 guests.</p><p>The couple has two children together: Jonathan Rosebanks and Jack. Jonathan is five years old and Jack is two. They are rarely seen in public as their parents prefer privacy and do not divulge much about their personal life.</p><p>Anne Hathaway’s husband is the ideal one to be stranded alone with when quarantined. Anne herself revealed this when she talked about the challenges she faced in this pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>“In the early days of lockdown we were all so overwhelmed and there was a lot to process and I needed a release but I didn’t want to scare my kids, so I screamed into a pillow a lot.”</p><p>Other than that, the couple is very happy to be with each other.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCtzaecZqCRqbWiw8CyqmagpaivorrDZpidmZ1iwKnBy6aYp2c%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanne-hathaways-husband-adam-shulman.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fanne-hathaways-husband-adam-shulman.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fanne-hathaways-husband-adam-shulman.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fanne-hathaways-husband-adam-shulman.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanne-hathaways-husband-adam-shulman.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanne-hathaways-husband-adam-shulman.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alex-rodriguez-has-a-huge-picture-of-himself-jennifer-lopez-above-his-bed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alex-rodriguez-has-a-huge-picture-of-himself-jennifer-lopez-above-his-bed.html>Alex Rodriguez Has a Huge Picture of Himself, Jennifer Lopez Above His Bed</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./20-actors-who-played-in-both-marvel-and-dc-movies.html>20 Actors Who Played In Both Marvel And DC Movies</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./20-actors-who-played-in-both-marvel-and-dc-movies.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
