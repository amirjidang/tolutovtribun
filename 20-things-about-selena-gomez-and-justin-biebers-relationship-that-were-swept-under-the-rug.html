For over a decade, Justin has serenaded millions of gals with his lyrics adorned with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">promises of puppy love</a>. Posters featuring his likeness have adorned countless bedroom walls, and his signature baby-faced look won over many hearts back in the day!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Justin's real-life relationship with winning over women has involved the breaking of some hearts; a dose of reality and a sign our JB has grown up a bit. Long before Justin wanted the world to know how much he loves his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">missus</a>, he won (and broke) the heart of Selena Gomez, the Disney darling who evolved into the mature songstress who has let fans in on a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tidbit</a> about her and Mr. Bieber's whirlwind romance. Here are 20 additional tidbits!</p><h2 id=selena-went-numb-over-the-biebs><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Selena Went 'Numb' Over The Biebs</span></h2><p>Selena's bop about her longtime love spilled the tea within the first minute; she says, "In two months you replaced us." This slice of autobiographical pie was brought to us by her ex's fiercely fast timing between the end of the 'Jelena' relationship and the beginning of his relationship with his eventual bride, Hailey Baldwin.</p><p>Selena <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> she felt "numb" upon learning of their relationship!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drama-with-justin-made-selena-feel-stupid><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Drama With Justin Made Selena Feel 'Stupid'</span></h2><p>Selena's vulnerability through her lyrics isn't new. Even in the middle of her longtime relationship with Justin, Selena stepped into the recording studio and released, "The Heart Wants What It Wants," a ballad she's performed in public many times, where she's had to relive her confusion and sadness over the state of their relationship.</p><p>The recording process was very <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">intimate</a>; Selena's mic was hidden!</p><h2 id=their-first-date-involved-passion-over-pancakes><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Their First Date Involved Passion Over Pancakes</span></h2><p>It's hard to believe, but there was a time when these wildly successful celebrities were just two teens in love!</p><p>Remember those dates from teenhood full of awkwardness, but still full of sweet puppy love? Selena and Justin's first date was a classic date you'd go on as a young couple; the duo had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">breakfast</a> together and bonded over pancakes. How syrupy sweet!</p><h2 id=selena-made-justin-shed-some-tears><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Selena Made Justin Shed Some Tears</span></h2><p>Relationships can be tough and it's rare for couples to speak about the difficult moments. Selena didn't share this sentiment; when she and Justin split for the first time, Selena was ready to spill!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Selena's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with David Letterman began as a simple interview, but ended as revealing tell-all about their breakup! David makes a joke about making Justin cry, and so does Selena!</p><h2 id=selena-did-this-super-sketchy-activity-after-their-first-breakup><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Selena Did This Super Sketchy Activity After Their First Breakup</span></h2><p>Between the breakups and makeups between Selena and Justin, there was plenty of room for Selena to do what she needed in order to step away from the Biebs!</p><p>During a Bieber off-season, Selena <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">went to blow off steam</a> at a shooting range, and she captured the event in a since-deleted post on social media. Selena wasn't specific, but timelines show it was a Bieber-blowout.</p><h2 id=the-duo-had-a-rocky-relationship-with-vacations><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>The Duo Had A Rocky Relationship With Vacations</span></h2><p>Vacations with your beau are supposed to be full of potential, and let's be real, downright romantic! Unfortunately for Selena and Justin, they seemed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">struggle</a> when they took the time for some relaxation!</p><p>Selena and Justin's efforts to have some private time together were often cut short when the duo would have arguments that weren't exactly serene. Once, Selena flew home early!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-was-forced-to-be-kandid-over-a-jenner><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Justin Was Forced To Be 'Kandid' Over A Jenner</span></h2><p>Justin Bieber may have a few female leads in his life, but we almost never hear about the "supporting" cast members in his realm!</p><p>The woman who sits between Selena and Hailey Baldwin is a woman we're all familiar with: Kylie Jenner.</p><p>A flame was lit between Selena and the famous friends when she discovered "photos of Kylie on his phone," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according</a> to Cosmo. Eek!</p><h2 id=orlando-bloom-wasn-t-having-justin-s-chaos-over-selena><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Orlando Bloom Wasn't Having Justin's Chaos Over Selena</span></h2><p>Even though Selena may have felt super sad during her break from Justin, she wasted no time meeting and spending time with one of the hottest men in Hollywood!</p><p>Selena spent a bit of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">time</a> with Orlando Bloom during a Bieber off-season! Orlando, however, had no time to spend agonizing over Selena's former beau's shenanigans. Biebs and Bloom once had a rough <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">encounter</a> featuring fists!</p><h2 id=another-woman-in-justin-s-life-wasn-t-over-jelena><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Another Woman In Justin's Life Wasn't Over 'Jelena'</span></h2><p>One of the surefire signs you're succeeding in a relationship is if you've got the stamp of approval from your significant other's parents! It's a different story, however, when your S/O's mother is still carrying a torch for you, even after your relationship's flame burns out!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Justin's mother, Patti, was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tight enough</a> with Selena, despite her son's rocky relationship, even exchanging messages with Selena online!</p><h2 id=justin-s-girl-made-him-stop-listening-to-music><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Justin's Girl Made Him Stop Listening To Music</span></h2><p>Sorry, not sorry, JB!</p><p>Selena did exactly what she felt she needed to do in order to get over her on-again, off-again beau; she dove back into the dating pool! Her first public relationship after Justin was a ten-month <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">courtship</a> with The Weeknd.</p><p>Justin surely couldn't avoid The Weeknd back in 2017; his songs were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all over the radio</a>, much to Justin's chagrin!</p><h2 id=hockey-was-close-to-their-hearts><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Hockey Was Close To Their Hearts</span></h2><p>At a point when Selena and Justin's relationship was heating up again after a hiatus, the pair discovered they enjoyed partaking in an activity a bit chillier than their relationship status at the time.</p><p>Selena embraced one of her boyfriend's passionate and personal pastimes: hockey! When 'Jelena' reunited (yet again) in 2017, they were photographed snuggling at the ice rink!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-families-weren-t-having-fun-with-their-relationship><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Their Families Weren't Having Fun With Their Relationship</span></h2><p>If 'Jelena's' emotional rollercoaster of a relationship was hard for fans to keep tabs on, imagine how difficult it may have felt to those closest to the couple!</p><p>Selena's relationship with her mother has been known to be just as sporadic as her relationship with Justin. When her mother Mandy was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">questioned</a> about her daughter's reconciliation with Justin, Mama had very few positive things to say.</p><h2 id=justin-questionably-handled-a-significant-event-in-selena-s-life><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Justin Questionably Handled A Significant Event In Selena's Life</span></h2><p>Justin may not have been Selena's forever, but she has plenty of "forevers" in her life. Her relationship with her fans has certainly outlasted her relationship with The Biebs and her vow to always be transparent may have something to do with it.</p><p>Sel shared an incredibly intimate photo with her fans revealing she had a kidney transplant. Justin, however, seemed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">miss</a> the memo.</p><h2 id=selena-loved-to-get-cryptic><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Selena Loved To Get Cryptic</span></h2><p>What fun would it be if our favorite celebs revealed every bit of their personal lives, leaving no evidence for fans to uncover? None, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Selena certainly kept as tight-lipped as possible while penning songs about her Bieber beau. She isn't really the type to sing and tell, but fans have kept their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ears open</a> and were ready to analyze any new lyrics for tidbits!</p><h2 id=selena-s-beau-had-to-be-okay-with-her-ex-boyfriend><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Selena's Beau Had To Be Okay With Her Ex-Boyfriend</span></h2><p>Despite the fact that Selena and Justin found new partners during their off-season, it doesn't mean Selena was necessarily ready to let her ex-boyfriend go. What exactly was your purpose, Selena?</p><p>Her leftover feelings for Justin lingered a bit when Selena began dating the Weeknd. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According</a> to Vogue Australia, the status of their relationship was quiet for a bit as she had "friendly" breakfasts with Justin.</p><h2 id=the-pair-moved-in-together-extremely-early><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Pair Moved In Together Extremely Early</span></h2><p>Wow, put on the brakes!</p><p>It goes without saying Justin and Selena's relationship was intense at times. Now that we know this fact that the former couple would understandably want to sweep under the rug, we can see why their love was so strong!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According</a> to Cosmopolitan, Justin revealed to Complex, "I moved in with my girlfriend when I was 18." Serious, much?</p><h2 id=justin-even-bought-sel-a-sparkler><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Justin Even Bought Sel A Sparkler</span></h2><p>Way before Justin was making headlines for presenting his sudden bride-to-be, Hailey Baldwin, with an engagement ring, he had some practice. There's no doubt both Justin and Hailey would want the fact that he once bought a ring for his former flame to be swept under the rug!</p><p>Yes, that's right; Justin&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bought</a> some bling for Selena.</p><h2 id=selena-was-practical-about-justin-s-joking-ways><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Selena Was Practical About Justin's Joking Ways</span></h2><p>There are lots of aspects of being in the public eye that a celebrity may not want to reveal, like the pressure to grow up fast and never act your actual age. Justin Bieber was a teen idol, but his career and fame left him little time to act his age, so he had to seize any moment he could!</p><p>He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">often enjoyed</a> pranking Selena.</p><h2 id=mamas-made-it-happen><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Mamas Made It Happen</span></h2><p>Despite Selena's mother's later reluctance for the young lovers to reunite, she was all about a potential relationship between her daughter and the floppy-haired "Baby" singer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reminiscent of a classic love story, the saga of 'Jelena' began with a phone call between two moms, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according</a> to Teen Vogue. Pattie and Mandy were eager to see where their young entertainers could go!</p><h2 id=bieber-was-like-a-brother-to-her><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Bieber Was Like A 'Brother' To Her</span></h2><p>Don't toy with us, Selena!</p><p>Buzz surrounding a potential relationship with Justin Bieber pretty much began immediately when the youngins were first spotted out together, and, as the pair grew more comfortable together, they began gradually taking their relationship public. Selena wasn't quite ready to spill the beans during an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with Ellen DeGeneres, where she comically <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">referred to</a> Justin as her "little brother!"</p><p>References:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PopSugar</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhpaWWknbavs9JmmJunpal6tLHLnqWaZZekuqbGjJqlnWWaqsC1tc1mmaKdkpq%2FtHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkraCRqXq4sdGeZKyvlaXBbsHNnZyrZaSdsm6%2B1KBm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f20-things-about-selena-gomez-and-justin-biebers-relationship-that-were-swept-under-the-rug.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f20-things-about-selena-gomez-and-justin-biebers-relationship-that-were-swept-under-the-rug.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f20-things-about-selena-gomez-and-justin-biebers-relationship-that-were-swept-under-the-rug.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f20-things-about-selena-gomez-and-justin-biebers-relationship-that-were-swept-under-the-rug.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20-things-about-selena-gomez-and-justin-biebers-relationship-that-were-swept-under-the-rug.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20-things-about-selena-gomez-and-justin-biebers-relationship-that-were-swept-under-the-rug.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alisyn-camerota-bio-age-husband-cnn-fox-news-salary-net-worthtwitter-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alisyn-camerota-bio-age-husband-cnn-fox-news-salary-net-worthtwitter-2.html>Alisyn Camerota Bio, Age, Husband, CNN, Fox News, Salary, Net Worth,Twitter</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./15-reasons-sausage-party-is-the-worst-movie-of-all-time.html>15 Reasons Sausage Party Is The Worst Movie Of All Time</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./15-reasons-sausage-party-is-the-worst-movie-of-all-time.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
