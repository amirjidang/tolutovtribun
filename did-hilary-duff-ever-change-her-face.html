"I struggled a little bit when I was 18 or 19 with food. And wanting to fit into this 'image' of a girl who is not me. But that was such a long time ago," she confessed. "Honestly, I feel like I'm in the same five- to 10-pound struggle as most other women out there. Sometimes I'm crushing it and feeling great, and other times I'm like, ugh." She added that being a mother has allowed her to get past it. "I love to cook and, honestly, being a mom and being consistently busy helps keep my priorities straight," shared <a href=#>the Cinderella Story star</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, she's developed a fitness routine that keeps her in shape without starving herself. "Obviously I want to be in shape, but I think working out is more of a mental health thing for me. Just to be outside—I hike a lot; I swim a lot," she told the publication "And then training, doing weights and feeling strong, getting those endorphins pumping through your body is really important for your happiness. I work out a lot. Obviously, I want to be fit, but I'm 5'2'' and I'm definitely not a 'skinny girl.' I'm a healthy girl. I always feel really empowered by what my body can do—having babies, getting pregnant, or swinging Luca around. He's like 45 pounds, and I'm dangling him by his ankles and chasing him all around. So I'm so grateful that I'm strong and my body's there for me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hilary Duff And Francia Raisa: Are They Friends In Real Life?</a></span></p><h2 id=did-hilary-duff-get-plastic-surgery>Did Hilary Duff Get Plastic Surgery?</h2><p>Duff hasn't directly spoken about getting work done on her face. However, she did admit that she had her smile fixed. She told People that she got veneers on her two front teeth after chipping them on a microphone during an intense performance. After that, <a href=#>the How I Met Your Father actress</a> lost a tooth the morning of her wedding to Matthew Koma in 2010. Fortunately, her brother-in-law's best friend was a dentist who lived close by. "I burst into tears. Then I started laughing at myself, and then I really burst into tears," Duff told Ellen DeGeneres. "Thank God I didn’t swallow [my tooth]. Not good for a bride on her wedding day."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2014, <a href=#>the Cheaper by the Dozen star</a> was accused of getting lip fillers. She quickly shut down the rumors, saying: "Same lips I've always had … In this case, it's just red lipstick and a fancy angle." When asked about her secret to looking young, she said that it's all about being young at heart. "I've had to be mature my whole life since I've had a career since I was what, 10 or 11? But my personality is very young and I have a lot of energy," she told Paste. "I think that sometimes I feel like the baby, and then other times, I'm like 'Whoa, I'm too old to be here or too old to be doing this.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Disney Tried To Bully Hilary Duff Into Making This Film</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hilary-duff-is-39-proud-39-of-her-current-body>Hilary Duff Is 'Proud' Of Her Current Body</h2><p>Recently, Duff made the cover of Women's Health where she was photographed nude. Though she was initially scared of doing it, she "felt strong and beautiful and laughed a lot getting into some of these poses without my high waisted mom jeans and oversized whatever I normally wear," she said. "Thank you to everyone who normalized this day for me and propped me up with compliments and love." Her husband was also supportive of her daring photos.

"I'm proud of my body. I'm proud that it's produced three children for me," she said. "I've gotten to a place of being peaceful with the changes my body has gone through." She added that aging has only made her love her body more. "I think that at 34, I have just gained a lot of respect for my body," she told the magazine. "It's taken me all the places I need to go. It's helped me build a beautiful family. I feel like the older I get, the more confident I get in my own skin and my body's been many different shapes and sizes, and I'm really just fascinated by, one, being a woman and, two, all the changes that your body can go through throughout your lifetime."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Much Did Hilary Duff’s Music Career Contribute To Her Net Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdnbatrdGyZJ2tlpt6psLEq2ScoJGjtKZ5x56pZp6RmLJw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-hilary-duff-ever-change-her-face.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-hilary-duff-ever-change-her-face.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-hilary-duff-ever-change-her-face.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-hilary-duff-ever-change-her-face.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-hilary-duff-ever-change-her-face.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-hilary-duff-ever-change-her-face.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./fans-speculate-about-laverne-cox-character-kacy-duke-from-inventing-anna-where-is-fitness-guru-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./fans-speculate-about-laverne-cox-character-kacy-duke-from-inventing-anna-where-is-fitness-guru-now.html>Fans Speculate About Laverne Cox Character Kacy Duke From Inventing Anna, Where Is Fitness Guru Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./delilah-hamlin-seemingly-shades-lisa-rinna-harry-over-trauma.html>Delilah Hamlin Seemingly Shades Lisa Rinna, Harry Over 'Trauma'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./delilah-hamlin-seemingly-shades-lisa-rinna-harry-over-trauma.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
