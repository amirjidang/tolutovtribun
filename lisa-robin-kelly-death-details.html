Before she got caught up in drug abuse and the law, Kelly was best known for portraying Laurie Forman in the hit sitcom That '70s Show. She was re-cast during the show after getting into trouble, and actress Christina Moore stepped in for the final seasons to play the role of Eric's older sister. A spinoff of the television show just aired on Netflix titled That '90s Show. <a href=# rel=nofollow>The show features many guest appearances</a> of the original cast, but the character of Laurie Forman is not included in the sequel series. Creators of That '90s Show did not want to disrespect the memory of Lisa Robin Kelly by having her character in the new show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Sad Reason Lisa Robin Kelly's That '70s Show Scenes From Season 6 Needed To Be Reshot</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lisa-robin-kelly-passed-away-in-2013>Lisa Robin Kelly Passed Away In 2013</h2><p>Lisa Robin Kelly was born in Southington, Connecticut in 1970. She earned a BFA in acting from The Theater School at DePaul University in Chicago in 1992. Kelly went on to have guest roles on the X Files and Days Of Our Lives. But she became a household name alongside Mila Kunis, Laura Prepon and Ashton Kutcher on That's 70s Show. Kelly shone as the sassy Laurie Foreman - the older sister of Eric - played by Topher Grace.</p><p>But fans were left confused when she abruptly left the show midway through the third season. At the time the official line was that her character left home to "attend beauty school." She returned to the show in the fifth season, but only appeared for four episodes. Kelly was eventually <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">replaced by Christina Moore </a>in the sixth season. In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>, Kelly admitted that she lost her job on That 70s Show because of a drinking problem. Kelly attributed her abuse to trauma following a miscarriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lisa-robin-kelly-had-multiple-run-ins-with-the-law>Lisa Robin Kelly Had Multiple Run Ins With The Law</h2><p>In August 2010, Kelly was arrested in North Carolina on a charge of driving under the influence. She pleaded guilty and was fined and sentenced to 12 months of unsupervised probation. Two years later she was arrested on a felony charge of corporal injury upon a spouse and was released on $10,000 bail. The charge was based on a complaint filed by her ex-boyfriend, John Michas.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>That '70s Show Star Lisa Robin Kelly Was Planning To Make A Comeback Just Prior To Her Passing</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kelly vehemently denied being the assailant and claimed Michas attacked her. The Los Angeles County District Attorney declined to file charges. On June 23, 2013, Kelly was arrested for a suspected DUI when law enforcement responded to a call about a parked car blocking a lane of traffic on the I-5 freeway. She subsequently failed a field-sobriety test.</p><p>In October 2012, a year before she passed, Lisa Robin Kelly, married 61-year-old husband Robert Joseph Gilliam. But in November she was charged in connection with a disturbance at her North Carolina. She later filed for divorce. "I am having a great day, free at last ,free at last. LMFAO. I AM OFFICIALLY DONE WITH MY MARRIAGE," she wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Twitter</a>.</p><h2 id=lisa-robin-kelly-went-to-rehab-a-few-days-before-her-passing>Lisa Robin Kelly Went To Rehab A Few Days Before Her Passing</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In June 2013, Kelly voluntarily checked into Pax Rehab House in Altadena, California. But sadly, she passed in her room just a couple of days later. She was just 43. At the time sources claimed there was no evidence of any foul play in her room when she passed. In January 2014, The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner concluded that her death was due to an accidental unspecified oral "multiple intoxication."</p><p>Following her passing, her estranged husband Robert filed a wrongful death suit against Pax House and the owners - James and Marcia Burnett - as he claimed they were "improperly trained to care for patients such as his wife". Three years later, his lawyer confirmed that they had reached a settlement, but did not disclose its value.</p><p>Kelly's That 70s Show co-hosts took to social media to mourn her death.</p><p>Danny Masterson, who starred as Steven Hyde on That '70's Show tweeted: "Terrible, awful news. Brilliant on 70s....

"I know the last 10 years have been such a difficult struggle for her. But I will always remember the lovely, funny and very talented young lady I worked with."</p><p>Kelly's agent, Craig Wyckoff, said in a statement that the actress had been hoping to start a new chapter after years of struggling with substance abuse and related legal issues.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>What That '70s Show Cast Thinks Of Netflix's Reboot, That '90s Show</a></span></p><p>"Lisa had voluntarily checked herself into a treatment facility early this week where she was battling the addiction problems that have plagued her these past few years," he said.

The streaming service created That '90s Show, which follows the life of Leia Forman as she spends the summer in Point Place with her grandparents. Many original cast members from That '70s Show are making appearances in the new series, but several characters did not make the final cut.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Danny Masterson's Steven Hyde is not mentioned in </a><a href=# rel=nofollow>That '90s Show</a> due to his arrest and trial of rape. The character of Laurie Forman is also not in the spinoff show. Though That '70s Show recast the character for Christina Moore after Lisa Robin Kelly was fired, creators of That '90s Show thought it would be insensitive to include the character considering her death in 2013. Eric's older sister is not featured at all in the Netflix original show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoquRYr%2BwrsinZKSdnKHGbrDEmquhZZSawaK1y6xm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flisa-robin-kelly-death-details.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flisa-robin-kelly-death-details.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flisa-robin-kelly-death-details.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flisa-robin-kelly-death-details.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flisa-robin-kelly-death-details.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flisa-robin-kelly-death-details.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mr-smiths-watches-these-are-the-most-expensive-watches-in-brad-pitts-collection.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mr-smiths-watches-these-are-the-most-expensive-watches-in-brad-pitts-collection.html>These Are The Most Expensive Watches In Brad Pitt's Collection</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-cast-of-emily-in-paris-ranked-by-net-worth.html>The Cast Of 'Emily In Paris', Ranked By Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-cast-of-emily-in-paris-ranked-by-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
