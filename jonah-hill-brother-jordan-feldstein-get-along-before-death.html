From police officer Schmidt in 21 Jump Street to teenager Seth in Superbad, Hill often plays uncomfortable but endearing characters who often make the situations that they're in worse. And that is always funny and relatable. Off-screen, Jonah Hill has had some hard times. The <a href=#>actor has struggled with anxiety</a>. And in December 2017, Hill's brother <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordan Feldstein died from "pulmonary thromboembolism"</a> and a blood clot that was found in his leg, according to Variety.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Feldstein was a music manager for Maroon 5 and was only 40 years old at the time. Losing a sibling is one of the most gut-wrenching things that anyone can go through. Did Jonah Hill and Jordan Feldstein get along before his terrible death?</p><h2 id=what-was-jonah-hill-39-s-relationship-like-with-his-late-brother-jordan-feldstein>What Was Jonah Hill's Relationship Like With His Late Brother Jordan Feldstein?</h2><p><a href=#>Jonah Hill and sister Beanie Feldstein are very close</a>. And it looks like Hill was just as close with Jordan Feldstein before he passed away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jordan-feldstein.jpg><p>Hill talked about his relationship with his brother in Stutz, the documentary that he made for Netflix with Phil Stutz, a therapist who he has been working with for a while. The movie feels raw and offers a more intimate look at Hill's inner world. It's a reminder that he's a very thoughtful celebrity who stands apart from many others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hill said that nothing has stopped how much his grief hurts. He said in the movie, “I still feel that pain every day. I still miss my brother.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jonah-hill-1.jpg><p>Hill told the story of learning about his brother's passing and then going to talk to Stutz in his office. He and Stutz talked about how Stutz knew that it was a pivotal moment in his life and took a picture of him so they could reflect back on it later on.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jonah Hill Was Hospitalized During The Wolf Of Wall Street Because Of A Vitamin Powder Overdose</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jonah Hill stopped using Instagram because of anxiety in August 2022, according to Page Six. However, he posted a photo of himself, Jordan Feldstein, and Kobe Bryant in 2020. He noted that while people had made memes of the photo, since both Feldstein and Bryant had died, the meaning behind the picture had changed significantly.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonah Hill wrote about the photo</a>, according to Entertainment Weekly. And he had some really sweet things to say about his brother. He talked about what an amazing experience it is to look back on. And based on the actor's words, it definitely seems like he loves his late brother very much, and they were really close.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jonah-hill.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hill wrote, “I’m sitting next to my brother and he’s taking this. It was the night we both met Kobe and he was so nice to us. So funny, so amazing and so kind (in the middle of a game!). My brother and I grew up worshiping the Lakers and because of my job we got to sit next to Kobe and the whole team! I have lived a privileged life. Truly. We were literally buzzing with excitement to meet our hero and it’s one of my favorite memories ever."</p><p>Hill continued, "It’s my favorite memory with my brother. I’m sitting between Kobe and my brother and now they’re both gone.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jonah Hill Turned Down The Role That Changed Adam Sandler's Career In Uncut Gems</a></span></p><p>Hill was philosophical about the moment. He wrote that this is an example of how "fleeting" experiences are. He noted that "their fleeting nature doesn’t make them any less beautiful."</p><p>It's really sad to hear Hill talk about Feldstein. It sounds like he likes to keep his memory alive by thinking about the good times that they shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-has-jordan-feldstein-39-s-death-affected-jonah-hill-39-s-relationship-with-sister-beanie-feldstein>How Has Jordan Feldstein's Death Affected Jonah Hill's Relationship With Sister Beanie Feldstein?</h2><p>It seems like Jonah Hill and his sister Beanie Feldstein have stayed in each other's lives despite the wild nature of their acting careers. Even as they have both gotten super famous, they seem to still have the same bond as ever.</p><p>Losing a sibling can bring other family members together and it looks like Hill and his sister have cemented their bond even more since losing Jordan Feldstein.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jonah-hill-beanie-feldstein.jpg><p>When she was interviewed for The Cut in March 2023, the actress said that it can be hard for her to call her brother Jonah Hill because she grew up with him using her family's last name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She told The Cut that they have a good relationship and that they became closer when Jordan died. She said, "But he's my best friend. We are very close.

Jonah Hill shared more about his family dynamic in an interview with The Huffington Post in 2011.</p><p>The actor, who was 27 at the time, was dealing with a home renovation, and he said that he was staying at his parents' house in the meantime.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jonah-hill-1-1.jpg><p>Hill talked about being close with his parents Sharon Lyn Chalkin and Richard Feldstein. He mentioned that he enjoyed being near them but also wanted his independence. And anyone who has lived with their parents or other family members as an adult can definitely relate.</p><p>The actor told The Huffington Post, "I love my parents. But I'm almost 28 and it's not fun to be asked, 'What are you doing today? What do you want for dinner? When are you going to be home?' It just makes you feel like a kid. It's this juxtaposition of feeling annoyed and really lucky to have people who love you so much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hill also mentioned that at that point, Beanie Feldstein had become a college student. He mentioned how hard that was for him. He said, "It's very sad for me because we're very close, so instead of getting another apartment while my house is being renovated or be in a hotel, I liked to spend that time with her before she was leaving for the next chapter in her life."</p><p>Hearing Jonah Hill speak so kindly about his sister and parents makes the loss of his brother Jordan Feldstein feel even more acute. It sounds like the entire family has always really cared about each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKaRnXqptculZJuqn6m1pr6Mo6arnJGjeqexy52qrZ2Zo3qosdNmmKWnnpx6o7HFqKmeZZSarrW0jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjonah-hill-brother-jordan-feldstein-get-along-before-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjonah-hill-brother-jordan-feldstein-get-along-before-death.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjonah-hill-brother-jordan-feldstein-get-along-before-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjonah-hill-brother-jordan-feldstein-get-along-before-death.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjonah-hill-brother-jordan-feldstein-get-along-before-death.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjonah-hill-brother-jordan-feldstein-get-along-before-death.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dion-dawkins-wife-is-dion-dawkins-married-who-is-dion-dawkins-girlfriend.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dion-dawkins-wife-is-dion-dawkins-married-who-is-dion-dawkins-girlfriend.html>Dion Dawkins Wife: Is Dion Dawkins Married?
