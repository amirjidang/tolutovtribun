How about the other cast members?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hannah van der Westhuizen as Stella:&nbsp;Hannah is 25 years old, and she was born in London, England. Fate: The Winx Saga is her big breakout role.
