The two actresses are not that far apart in age, but of course, at the time, she was about 15 and Jennifer was in her early 20s, so the age difference was a lot more notorious</strong>.</p><p><strong>Mayim posted the throwback pic and captioned it with "Just refound this. Youâ€™re welcome", and tagged Jennifer Aniston</strong>. The Friends actress was practically unrecognizable, and it took fans some time to place her. At the time, Jennifer's hair was very dark, and she had a pixie cut.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Jennifer Aniston and Mayim Bialik worked together in the short-lived sitcom Molloy, right before they both had their breakout roles in Friends and Blossom respectively</strong>, and although it wasn't a huge part of their careers, they look back on it fondly.</p><p>This is not the first time Mayim posted a throwback to her collaboration with Jennifer Aniston. <strong>Back in 2015, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she posted a picture of the two of them</a>, which she captioned proudly saying "Yes this is me and Jennifer Aniston in my childhood bedroom."</strong></p><h2 id=mayim-bialik-39-s-recent-departure-from-39-jeopardy-39>Mayim Bialik's Recent Departure From 'Jeopardy!'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/mayim-bialik-los-angeles-lgbt-centre-gala.jpg><p>It's fitting that Mayim Bialik would look back on her past work now that a chapter of her professional life is ending. <strong>In December 2023, it was announced that she would be stepping down as host of Jeopardy! and that Ken Jennings would become the only presenter.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She was fired from the show, but it doesn't necessarily mean that there's bad blood between her and the producers of the show. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Showrunner Michael Davies spoke about it</a> recently, sharing the reasons behind her firing.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/why-was-mayim-bialik-let-go-from-jeopardy_-front-deposit-back-jeopardy_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Mayim Bialik's Hosting Duties On Jeopardy Turned Into A Complete Nightmare</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Mayim Bialik was allegedly outperformed by former contestant, Ken Jennings.</span><p>"When I took over the show, we were really forced into that situation from everything that happened before, the guest hosting period," he said. "Mayim was left hosting the primetime versions; I brought in Ken to guest-host once Mayim had her schedule on her Fox sitcom."</p><p><strong>This setup wasn't working for them, and the network decided that they wanted more "consistency", meaning, a single host. In his opinion, Ken Jennings "won the job."</strong></p><p>Still, that doesn't mean he doesn't appreciate her work. "<strong>Mayim is a superb host. We hope to keep working with her on primetime versions and other spinoffs</strong>," the showrunner said, and added that "Those conversations are ongoing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If the door is open for Mayim to return to Jeopardy!, it might also be open for another collaboration with Jennifer Aniston.
