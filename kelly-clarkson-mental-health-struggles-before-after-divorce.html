She has <a href=#>shared her real thoughts about dating post-divorce</a> and has talked about the mental health issue that she faced while going through her split from Blackstock.

According to Today.com, Clarkson said that she hoped to win a part in her school musical.

The lesson I took from that was purely superficial, but that’s what I grew up thinking for a long time. It wasn’t smart, and I headed straight into an eating disorder and became bulimic for the next six months."</p><p>Clarkson shared that a classmate helped her and she got better. However, several years later as her music career took off, the singer lost weight and <strong>struggled with her body image</strong>. In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Attitude magazine</a>, she explained that she thought about ending her life, which is heartbreaking to hear. She explained that when her third album "My December" came out, she began feeling more positive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar49972596-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kelly Clarkson Performed The One Song She Insisted No Artist Should Ever Cover</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The "American Idol" winner might be known for her covers, but there is one song she vowed never to perform.</span><p>Clarkson said she was "really skinny and unhappy" and continued, "I was miserable, like inside and out, for four years of my life.
