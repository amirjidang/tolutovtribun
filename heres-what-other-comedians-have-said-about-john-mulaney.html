News of his drug abuse and ensuing divorce haven't left the headlines in months, and all eyes have been on the former Saturday Night Live writer as he returns to the national touring circuit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 10 Best John Mulaney And Pete Davidson BFF Moments</a></span></p><p>He's spoken pretty candidly about all the drama, though some fans have made it clear they're done listening, as they don't approve of his <a href=#>presumed infidelity</a> to his now ex-wife Annamarie Tendler and his whirlwind affair <a href=#>with Olivia Munn</a>. It's not often you see a comedian as beloved as John Mulaney become such a polarizing figure. If his sold out touring shows are any indication, though, the mega talented star isn't going anywhere any time soon. Luckily he's got the support of many other comedians, many of whom spoke out in support of him during the most turbulent period of his career. Here's what some of them have said.</p><h2 id=seth-meyers><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Seth Meyers</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During John Mulaney's recent appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers, the pair <a href=#>recounted</a> the intervention Seth Meyers staged for John Mulaney, which he did with the help of other friends of theirs. The interview made waves for being quite candid as John Mulaney divulged intimate details about his multiple stints in rehab and the tumultuous divorce he has been going through. Seth Meyers expressed his surprise at the severity of John Mulaney's drug abuse given what Mulaney was like when the two first met on Saturday Night Live. "You were a young very successful comedian ... a wonderful writer but ... you were a square. Of all the people I knew in those easly years of your time at SNL you would be the one I would least predict to have [a drug problem]."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Close Are Nick Kroll And John Mulaney In Real Life?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bill-hader><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Bill Hader</span></h2><p>Bill Hader had a front row seat to John Mulaney's unfathomable talent and was one of the lucky few who can say they've actually <a href=#>performed</a> his material. "John Mulaney's a genius," he once told an interviewer during a promotional interview for the Pixar movie Inside Out. He recounted the hilarious-sounding writing process he shared with John Mulaney and couldn't help but laugh as he remembered one particularly funny moment in a restaurant where John pretended to endow other patrons with inner monologues he'd made up for them. "Your mother and I are separating," Mulaney joked to Hader, referring to a stern-looking dad sitting at the table right next to them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pete-davidson><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Pete Davidson</span></h2><p>Pete Davidson is known to be one of John Mulaney's <a href=#>closest comedian friends</a>, and the two funnymen were quite the dynamic duo every time that Mulaney came to host Saturday Night Live, a show which Pete Davidson stars on. They also went on to tour together, which became a BFF affair to remember. During a promotional shoot with Queer Eye's Tan France, Pete Davidson was lamenting the loneliness of the road life and noted that he couldn't do it without his bestie. "I'm not touring unless it's like, with Mulaney," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jenna-busch><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jenna Busch</span></h2><p>Podcast host and personality Jenna Busch shouted out John Mulaney <a href=#>on Twitter</a> recently in response to the rough year he's been having. "Hey <a href=#>@mulaney</a>! Your Netflix specials have gotten us all through the pandemic. I hope knowing how much support you have from your fans will help you get through treatment."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Instagram Savagely Trolls Olivia Munn After New Pic With John Mulaney Drops</a></span></p><h2 id=rachel-mccartney><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Rachel McCartney</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>New York-based comedian Rachel McCartney echoed many others when she expressed that the scandalous year John Mulaney has had has done nothing to dampen her physical attraction to him. She <a href=#>tweeted</a>: "Imagine getting pregnant for the first time at 41 and the dad is John Mulaney, who you started dating less than a year ago. Biggest W in women's history".</p><h2 id=patton-oswalt><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Patton Oswalt</span></h2><p>Patton Oswalt kept it simple, but still made sure to share support for his friend John Mulaney on <a href=#>Twitter</a>, sharing four lines of the heart emoji along with Mulaney's Twitter handle.

You are human and you got this.”</p><h2 id=tim-long><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Tim Long</span></h2><p>Funny man Tim Long, of The Simpsons fame, praised John Mulaney's talent and expressed empathy and support for the comedian, recounting John Mulaney's time on The Simpsons: "@mulaney is insanely talented, and was way nicer to me than he needed to be when he did @TheSimpsons. I hope he & everyone who's struggling these days get the help they need."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Really Happened Between John Mulaney And Ex Wife, Annamarie Tendler?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKismJq%2Fbq%2FOppydoZGjwG60wK%2BcZquRnrFurcGorK1lmqS1r3nMrqOappWufA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-what-other-comedians-have-said-about-john-mulaney.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheres-what-other-comedians-have-said-about-john-mulaney.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheres-what-other-comedians-have-said-about-john-mulaney.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheres-what-other-comedians-have-said-about-john-mulaney.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-what-other-comedians-have-said-about-john-mulaney.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-what-other-comedians-have-said-about-john-mulaney.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./irwin-winkler-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./irwin-winkler-net-worth.html>Irwin Winkler Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-many-homes-did-alex-murdaugh-have-barrett-boulware-and-moselle-history-explored-590800-html.html>How many homes did Alex Murdaugh have?
