TBBT aired for a total of 12 seasons, concluding in May 2019. As usual, the cast moved on to other projects when the show wrapped up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnny has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">keeping himself busy with different projects</a> as well as spending lots of time with his new-ish girlfriend, who is now the mother of his only son. Johnny's girlfriend is named Alaina Meyer. Before she started appearing on Galecki’s arm at social events and featuring on his social media pages, we didn't know too much about her. We are not certain when the two lovebirds started their romance or exactly where and how the pair met.</p><p>Galecki is not the most open person, especially where his private life is concerned, but after looking at some of their pics and doing a bit of digging. we unearthed some facts about the beautiful mystery woman that Galecki is head over heels for.</p><h2 id=meyer-is-from-san-diego><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><strong>Meyer Is From San Diego</strong></span></h2><p>Meyer was just another California native until she started dating the famous Johnny Galecki. The 23-year-old was born on February 2, 1997, in San Diego, California. After finishing school, Meyer worked as a fabricator manager. Since she was little, she has been obsessed with welding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-a-model><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><strong>She Is A Model</strong></span></h2><p>Everyone has his or her insecurities. For Galecki, it is his height. He does <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not like to talk about his 5’5’’ stature</a> and when he does discuss it, he is never ecstatic about it. Interestingly, Alaina is a model. Most models are not short, which is something we are sure Galecki knew. Alaina is slightly taller than 5’5’, so she's quite petite for a model.</p><h2 id=and-an-influencer><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>And An Influencer</strong></span></h2><p>Meyer goes by @alainamariemeyer on Instagram. She considers herself a social media influencer, which fits well with the fact that she is a model. Of course, after people found out that she was dating Galecki, her follower numbers shot up. However, her love for motorcycles (and many other fun things about the model) keep people interested in her for herself, rather than the fact that she is Galecki’s girlfriend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meyer-is-20-years-younger-than-galecki><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Meyer Is 20 Years Younger Than Galecki</strong></span></h2><p>When Meyer started seeing Galecki, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was 21 years old. Galecki was 44</a> at the time, which puts slightly more than 20 years of age between them. This also makes Galecki twice as old as his girlfriend. Nonetheless, the couple seems happy, which proves the old saying, 'age ain’t nothing but a number'.</p><h2 id=she-loves-horses-and-dogs><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>She Loves Horses And Dogs</strong></span></h2><p>One thing that is clear from Meyer’s social media pages is that the lady loves animals. She is most fascinated with horses and dogs. The animal lover plans to buy a piece of land and breed horses one day. She also likes dogs, which is clear from the different breeds of dogs she posts on Instagram.</p><h2 id=she-likes-traveling><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>She Likes Traveling</strong></span></h2><p>Which 20-something-year-old does not enjoy traveling? Definitely not Alaina Meyer! Most people in this age group are eager to explore the world and find their place, passion, or whatever it is that people are in search of out in the world. Before Galecki, she toured many places in the mainland USA.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14 Things About Penny And Leonard's Relationship That Made Zero Sense</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-young-lady-adores-her-father><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>The Young Lady Adores Her Father</strong></span></h2><p>Meyer has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very close relationship with her father</a>, John Stryker Meyer. This says a lot about the kind of parent she will be to her son. John served in the U.S. Army Special Forces and has written three books that detail his experience as a Green Beret during the Vietnam War.</p><h2 id=the-first-time-meyer-travelled-outside-the-country-was-in-2017><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>The First Time Meyer Travelled Outside The Country Was In 2017</strong></span></h2><p>The first time Meyer left the country, she went to Norway and this was just before she hooked up with Galecki. We are certain she had a good time in Norway, but she will have an even better time trotting around the globe with her baby daddy and son. The couple’s travel plans so far have mainly been within the United States.</p><h2 id=meyer-has-been-with-galecki-for-almost-two-years><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Meyer Has Been With Galecki For Almost Two Years</strong></span></h2><p>It isn't known for sure when Galecki and Meyer began their romantic relationship, but people speculate that the pair must have hooked up around mid-2018. Galecki and Meyer announced their relationship in September 2018. A month later, the couple appeared together in public at the People’s Choice Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Of Our Most Favorite Penny-Leonard Moments From 'Big Bang Theory'</a></span></p><h2 id=she-is-rumored-to-be-engaged-to-galecki><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>She Is Rumored To Be Engaged To Galecki</strong></span></h2><p>In December of 2018, Galecki posted a selfie of him and his girlfriend. One thing caught the attention of his fans. He and Meyer were wearing similar bands on their left ring fingers. The couple is not legally married - this is a fact Meyer has confirmed. However, that does not mean that the pair is not considering the idea.</p><h2 id=meyer-has-a-tattoo-of-galecki-s-initials><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Meyer Has A Tattoo Of Galecki’s Initials</strong></span></h2><p>Meyer loves tattoos and has several on her body. One of her recent tattoos is the letters JG on her left forearm, which are Johnny Galecki’s initials. Meyer is not the only one smitten with her lover; Galecki also has the initials, AMM, inked on his body, with a heart shape below them.</p><h2 id=she-has-visited-the-set-of-the-big-bang-theory><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>She Has Visited The Set Of The Big Bang Theory</strong></span></h2><p>Meyer met Galecki around the time he and his cast members were winding up the filming of The Big Bang Theory. Lucky for her, she still had an opportunity to visit the set of the comedy, before things were packed up. She also got the chance to see her man in his element.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Lesser Known Facts About Johnny Galecki And Jim Parsons' Off-Screen Friendship</a></span></p><h2 id=galecki-s-first-photo-on-her-instagram-account-was-posted-in-july-2018><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Galecki’s First Photo On Her Instagram Account Was Posted In July 2018</strong></span></h2><p>We still have not given up on trying to figure out exactly when these two lovebirds met. The first time Galecki appeared on Meyer’s Instagram page was in July 2018. However, the pair was in the company of other people. In August, Galecki shared a photo of himself hugging a woman who was later identified as Meyer.</p><h2 id=she-has-introduced-galecki-to-her-family><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>She Has Introduced Galecki To Her Family</strong></span></h2><p>Galecki and Meyer may not be husband and wife, but they are family, especially after they welcomed a baby late last year. The Meyers may be familiar with Leonard Hofstadter, but that does not mean that they know the real Galecki, which is why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meyer plans these meetings</a>. She wants her&nbsp;family to get to know her man.</p><h2 id=meyer-will-not-be-posting-any-pics-of-her-son-anytime-soon><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Meyer Will Not Be Posting Any Pics Of Her Son Anytime Soon</strong></span></h2><p>Meyer and Galecki welcomed their little bundle of joy in December 2019. The baby is about 6 months old. Except for close friends and family members, the rest of the world has no idea what the little champ looks like. Meyer intends to keep it that way, to give the child some privacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos Of Kaley Cuoco That’ll Make Johnny Galecki Lose Sleep</a></span></p><p>Sources: Eonline.com, Dailymail.co.uk, Popculture.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijnqujmr9ut82orqdllpawtb%2BMmpmoraRit7C0zaewZp%2BRobKkt8isZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmmZyWtq%2BtjKacsp2iZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flesser-known-facts-about-johnny-galeckis-girlfriend-alaina-meyer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flesser-known-facts-about-johnny-galeckis-girlfriend-alaina-meyer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flesser-known-facts-about-johnny-galeckis-girlfriend-alaina-meyer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flesser-known-facts-about-johnny-galeckis-girlfriend-alaina-meyer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flesser-known-facts-about-johnny-galeckis-girlfriend-alaina-meyer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flesser-known-facts-about-johnny-galeckis-girlfriend-alaina-meyer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lil-tay.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lil-tay.html>Lil Tay Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./last-13-models-in-the-sports-illustrated-bikini-calendar.html>Last 12 Models In The Sports Illustrated Bikini Calendar</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./last-13-models-in-the-sports-illustrated-bikini-calendar.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
