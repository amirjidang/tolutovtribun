At least, that seems to be the case with <a href=#>That ‘70s Show; it was sitcom magic!</a> And right now, everything that was old is new again. From the sixties' micromini to the eighties chunky jewelry, and, of course, ’90s everything else with a few early aughts thrown in for good measure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What about the ‘70s though? Have we left those out completely? Far from it. Today’s style pulls from such a melting pot of fashion from decades gone by that, whether you realize it or not, we have all dabbled in the ‘70s spirit a little bit. Who can blame us? The cast of <a href=#>That ’70s Show </a>was always dressed to the hilt in the best styles. They really went all out to make us feel like we were part of that era.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Oversized Everything Is So In Right Now And Nobody Does It Better Than Billie Eilish</a></span></p><p>The show's costume designer, Melina Root, meticulously researched and recreated the fashion trends of the 1970s, from Jackie's scarves and hats to the flannel and plaids of the rest of the gang. Melina even won a few Emmys for how well she depicted the style. The iconic outfits worn by the characters have become a major part of the show's legacy and continue to inspire fashion today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No, it's not just hip hugging bell bottom jeans and peace signs. The ‘70s gave way to quite a bit of fashion that is on trend today, fifty years later. For all those kids calling their parents 'Boomers’, they should check their wardrobe first.</p><h2 id=was-donna-fashionable-on-that-39-70s-show>Was Donna Fashionable On That '70s Show?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1-35.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Bell-Bottom Jeans</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Brown Leather 70s Clogs</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Peasant Top in Navy Blue</a></strong></p><p>Bellbottom jeans were much wider on the bottom than what passes for bell bottoms today. They were huge, and they were called hip huggers because the tops of them were so tiny that they hugged the hips like a second set of skin.

A T-strap up top is indicative of the era as well. While Mary Janes were around, the T-strap was really where it was at. And you can see from That '70s Show and other shows that take place in that time period that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">burgundy, maroon, and/or red were really popular colors</a> for footwear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=one-of-jackie-39-s-best-looks-on-that-39-70s-show>One Of Jackie's Best Looks On That '70s Show<img alt="Denim Romper or Jean Suit Metallic Platform Heels" height=628 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-35.jpg width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Denim Romper or Jean Suit</a></strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Metallic Platform Heels</a></p><p>Full denim jumpsuits were huge, as were romper style denim dresses and jean skirts.

For centuries, high heels have done a fantastic job of doing this, but in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1970s, platforms became widely popular,</a> and women fell in love with a new type of heightened shoe. The style even made a fiery comeback in the 1990s with the rise of the Spice Girls, and platform boots and sandals are making a big comeback right now.

One big thing to remember, though, is to make sure you know the band you're representing.

It's just not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A classic, funny graphic t-shirt is always good. In the 1970s, graphic t-shirts became extremely popular as a form of advertising. It was like logos are today. A full menu might be printed on a shirt from your favorite restaurant. People laugh at this today and wear them for chummy banter, but it was the real deal in the era it was made.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZmkYoRxv4ysn6ivXaTCtbLIrapmrJiWwW6t0Z5knK2ip7KvwMuyZK2qlaOxqrrGZmhyb2BiwLXFy55knaeeo65utsCcoqKdXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthat-70s-show-outfits-that-are-currently-trending-1970-style-donna-jackie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthat-70s-show-outfits-that-are-currently-trending-1970-style-donna-jackie.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthat-70s-show-outfits-that-are-currently-trending-1970-style-donna-jackie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthat-70s-show-outfits-that-are-currently-trending-1970-style-donna-jackie.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthat-70s-show-outfits-that-are-currently-trending-1970-style-donna-jackie.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthat-70s-show-outfits-that-are-currently-trending-1970-style-donna-jackie.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./trevor-wallace-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./trevor-wallace-net-worth.html>Trevor Wallace Net Worth How Much is Trevor Wallace Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./summer-house-stars-who-left-the-show-where-are-they-now.html>Summer House Stars Who Left the Show: Where Are They Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./summer-house-stars-who-left-the-show-where-are-they-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
