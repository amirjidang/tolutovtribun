Some actors were let go due to backstage drama, some were dramatically killed off and others were written out with heartbreaking goodbyes.Some of that behind-the-scenes turmoil that caused former Grey's Anatomy stars to be written out from the hit Shondaland drama is practically as dramatic and compelling as any on the ABC show's on-screen plots. Here are some reasons certain actors and characters were written of Grey's Anatomy during the 17 years it has been on air.<span class=article-alert>Spoiler Alert!

Knight, who came out as gay shortly after. While Washington initially denied the accusations, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor later released a statement apologizing for what he said</a>.</p><p>In 2007, Washington was confirmed to not be returning to the drama.

In 2007, Walsh left to enjoy her own spin-off show Private Practice. It saw Dr. Montgomery in a new location with new characters.

Brooke Smith was ultimately let go after the fifth season.</p><h2 id=katherine-heigl-left-greys-anatomy-to-be-a-mother><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Katherine Heigl Left 'Greys Anatomy' To Be A Mother</span></h2><p>Katherine Heigl is probably one of the more famous actresses to come out of Grey's Anatomy, becoming a household name thanks to her Emmy-winning performance as Dr. Izzie Stevens.

It was between me and the writers. I ambushed them, and it wasn’t very nice or fair," the star admitted much later.</p><p>Heigl says the real reason she quit the show in 2010 was because she had become a first-time mother. "I started a family, and it changed everything,” she said. “It changed my desire to work full-time. I went on family leave and just got to be a [mom], and it changed my whole perspective."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eric-dane-left-grey-s-anatomy-to-join-the-last-ship><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Eric Dane Left 'Grey's Anatomy' To Join 'The Last Ship'</span></h2><p>Eric Dane, who played Mark Sloan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">chose to join TNT's The Last Ship after years working on Grey's Anatomy.</a> The actor, who now appears in Euphoria, was killed off at the start of season 9 after suffering from the plane crash.

During season 11, fans were left devastated by the decision to have the character killed off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview, the actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed he felt it was the right time to leave</a>, believing that 10 years was "a long time to be on a show" and felt it was "very hard" to keep the plot engaging enough for one character after so many years.

The ball is in @ABCNetwork's court," she tweeted at the time.</p><p>According to sources behind the scenes Grey's Anatomy, there was "no bad blood" regarding the decision, and the choice to leave was entirely her own.
