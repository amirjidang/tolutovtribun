Reports are often released on <a href=#>rankings of the world's wealthiest, and women</a>&nbsp;get their separate list. A few such lists released in 2020 and 2021 had some well-known names on them. For example, famous figures like Alice Walton, Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, Mackenzie Scott, Jacqueline Mars, and Julia Koch were on the list. Some of them even have a multi-billion net worth.</p><p>But when it comes to spending this wealth, sugar mamas make it to the news quicker than any overachieving billionaires. These sugar mamas have been known to splurge their overflowing wealth and fame generously over their partners. The amount of money they have is so huge that it hardly causes them to look after their sugar babies.</p><p>Here is a list of such spendthrift yet generous sugar mamas.</p><h2 id=sandra-bullock>Sandra Bullock</h2><p>Sandra Bullock's net worth is estimated to be around $200-250 million. The movies in which she has acted in a lead role have usually&nbsp;grossed the $4.8 million budget, and she was once declared the highest-paid actor for two years straight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Sandra Bullock might be popular</a>, but she chooses to maintain her privacy. Despite that, her divorce from Jesse James became quite a discussed matter back in 2010. After that, she is known to have dated a young photographer, Bryan Randall, in 2015. Randall was also a fashion model back then at Vogue Paris. Randall himself might make a sumptuous sum of money, but he is nowhere close to his sugar mama, Sandra Bullock.</p><h2 id=madonna>Madonna</h2><p>Madonna has been vocal with the press about her interest in men younger than her when it comes to relationships. She openly demonstrated this kind of preference to the world when she got married to Guy Ritchie, who was at least ten years younger than her. The couple got divorced, but since then, Madonna has been dating men younger than her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kim Kardashian Spied On Madonna As A Kid</a></span></p><p>Her love interests Jesus Luz and Brahim Zaibat, were reported to be around 29 years younger than the star. She is currently dating choreographer Alhamalik Williams who is almost 36 years younger than the singer-songwriter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Madonna's net worth</a> is estimated to be around $550 million. Her successful career, the amassment of wealth and fame probably makes her one of the world's most desired sugar mamas.</p><h2 id=kris-jenner>Kris Jenner</h2><p><a href=#>Kris Jenner is one of the wealthiest women</a> who owns her own production company, Jenner Communications. She is raising and has raised her daughters as star kids with similar ambitions. Kris is worth about $190 million, making her a sugar mama, especially when she brings up her love life.</p><p>Kris Jenner's divorce with Bruce Jenner before he became Caitlyn is a well-known affair. Reports indicate that Kris had already started seeing other men during this divorce. She is known to have met her next boyfriend, Corey Gamble, at a party thrown by Kanye West in 2014. Corey is 25 years younger than her, but Corey is the one who got attracted to her and had made the first move. Corey Gamble was once Justin Beiber's tour manager and is known to have a considerable net worth. However, it is not much when compared to Kris Jenner's coffers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robin-wright>Robin Wright</h2><p><a href=#>Robin Wright is now famous</a> to the new generation as the actor in 'House Of Cards' and the&nbsp;'Wonder Woman'&nbsp;in 2017. But Wright's successful career dates back to the 80s with her big hit, 'The Princess Bride.' Later she became famous as the actress in 'Forrest Gumps.' Her net worth is estimated to be around $65 million.</p><p>Wright's first marriage with actor Sean Penn lasted for about 14 years, and they had two kids. Two years after divorcing Penn in 2010, Wright started dating again. She was with Ben Foster, who was about 14 years younger than the well-known actress. A couple of years later, she saw Clement Giraudet, who was born two decades after Wright. Being a VIP public relations manager, Giraudet has also accumulated an enormous chunk of wealth, but his fortune is dwarfed in front of Wright's.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-spears>Britney Spears</h2><p>Britney Spears is one of the most searched celebrities on the internet. Her career has gone through ups and downs, but she has never faded out of the spotlight. Britney has spent decades in the music industry, and her net worth is around $60 million.</p><p>She was last known to be dating a young trainer and model, Sam Asghari. Britney is said to be 13 years older than him, and they have been together since 2016. Asghari even worked on his physique to regulate his weight and become attractive and worthy for his popstar sugar mama, Britney Spears.</p><p>Some other well-known <a href=#>sugar mamas celebrities are Vivienne Westwood</a>, Joan Collins, and Petra Ecclestone. They have earned their name in the world as the richest women and as generous mamas to their sugar babies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Ways To Score A Sugar Mama</a></span></p><p>Sources - <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pablito's Way</a>, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Capitalist</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2Fqq%2FHnqqtZaOqtKK%2BjKaYppmjZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frichest-sugar-mamas.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frichest-sugar-mamas.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frichest-sugar-mamas.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frichest-sugar-mamas.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frichest-sugar-mamas.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frichest-sugar-mamas.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alarmed-movie-2023-on-tubi-cast-and-movie-review.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alarmed-movie-2023-on-tubi-cast-and-movie-review.html>Alarmed Movie (2023) On Tubi Cast and Movie Review</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./20-things-fans-should-know-about-vitalys-crazy-lifestyle.html>20 Things Fans Should Know About Vitaly's Crazy Lifestyle</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./20-things-fans-should-know-about-vitalys-crazy-lifestyle.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
