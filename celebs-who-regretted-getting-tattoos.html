Stars like Mark Wahlberg, who decided to remove all of his tattoos, including one of Bob Marley. And, Blake Shelton is continuing to rock his barb wire and deer track tattoo, even though he knows it wasn't a good look for him. If there's one thing we can count on, it's a celebrity getting another ridiculous tattoo, <a href=#>only to regret it a few days later</a>.</p><h2 id=mark-wahlberg><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mark Wahlberg</span></h2><p>Mark Wahlberg used to have tattoos all over his body but had them all removed as a sign of maturity and growth. According to&nbsp;Insider,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor wanted all of his tattoos removed </a>before his 2010 film&nbsp;The Fighter&nbsp;but was told by a dermatologist that it would take five to seven years to get them all removed.</p><p>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Was Mark Wahlberg Paid For 'Transformers'?</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the actor accelerated the process, having almost all of his tattoos removed in less than a year. Talking about the removal process, Wahlberg compared it to "hot bacon grease getting flicked on you over and over again."</p><h2 id=jessica-alba><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jessica Alba</span></h2><p>Jessica Alba had one or two big regrets and that was the ink she got when she was younger. While the actress has tattoos that she loves, including each of her children's zodiac signs, the ones she got before she was famous are no longer meaningful to her.</p><p><a href=#>The Honest Beauty founder</a> shared that she regrets getting two tattoos, which include her lower back tattoo of a bow and flowers on the back of her neck. Alba admitted that she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">started the tattoo removal process for her neck tattoo</a>, but unfortunately, it's not coming out.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Justin Bieber</span></h2><p><a href=#>Justin Bieber is covered in tattoos</a>, but his most infamous ink is a portrait of his ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez, located on his wrist. The face of the portrait, which appears to be Gomez with angel wings was inspired by the singer's&nbsp;Elle magazine photoshoot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Evolution Of Hailey Baldwin (In Pictures)</a></span></p><p>Bieber has since attempted to have it covered up with something else and even have the face altered, but fans all know who it is that's on his arm.

When Cuoco <a href=#>was married to tennis pro Ryan Sweeting, </a>she got a tattoo on the middle of her back of their wedding date, December 31, 2013. However, the couple ended up getting divorced and Cuoco was left with a reminder of him permanently etched into her skin.</p><p>Instead of removing the ink altogether, Cuoco got it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">covered up with a massive moth</a>. During an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, the star shared that she got the huge moth because it had wings large enough to cover the roman numerals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jennifer Lawrence</span></h2><p>Jennifer Lawrence <a href=#>has a small tattoo on her right hand</a> close to her thumb which reads, "H20," a symbol for water, and a reminder for the actress is always stay hydrated.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Do Chris Pratt And Jennifer Lawrence Have Such Great Chemistry On Film?</a></span></p><p>What Lawrence did not realize at the time was that her tattoo was factually incorrect because the 2 in H20 should be lower and not higher when writing out the chemical formula for water. But, Lawrence took it all in good stride and shared that thankfully most people can't even see it.</p><h2 id=megan-fox><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Megan Fox</span></h2><p>Megan Fox is known <a href=#>for her acting skills</a>, beauty, and her huge Marilyn Monroe tattoo on her forearm. However, in 2011, the actress began having the portrait of the iconic star removed because Fox <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wanted to avoid attracting "negative energy."</a></p><p>According to&nbsp;Daily Mail,&nbsp;Fox shared, "I'm removing it. It is a negative character, as she suffered from personality disorders and was bipolar.
