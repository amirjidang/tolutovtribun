Many fans have created memes declaring they want Morgan to narrate their life. Morgan's voice is so pleasing and iconic that people beg him just to speak. His former co-star Zach Braff once got Morgan to <a href=#>record a voicemail</a> for him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the time the 2000s rolled around, he already was in many award-winning films he could've hung his hat on. Despite that, he's continued to star in a plethora of movies that have won awards and knocked it out of the park at the box office. The legend loves acting so much that he has said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he'd prefer to pass away while acting.</a></p><p>As his career continues to go on, his salary continues to rise as well. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Morgan has accumulated $250 million over time. Here's how much his biggest movies have contributed to that.</p><h2 id=driving-miss-daisy-was-morgan-freeman-39-s-true-breakout-film><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Driving Miss Daisy Was Morgan Freeman's True Breakout Film</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/morgan-freeman-in-driving-miss-daisy.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Driving Miss Daisy was one of Morgan's first huge movies. He had been an actor for a while, but this movie was when mainstream audiences really were exposed to Morgan's legendary acting. While Morgan wasn't nominated for an Oscar directly, the movie was nominated a whopping nine times and ended up winning four of them.</p><p>It's unknown how much money Driving Miss Daisy made Morgan, but it did set the stage for Morgan's future checks. The movie itself grossed over $140 million at the box office, which would be the equivalent of $300 million at today's box office.</p><h2 id=the-shawshank-redemption-is-one-of-the-best-films-of-all-time><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Shawshank Redemption Is One Of The Best Films Of All Time</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tim-robbins-morgan-freeman-shawshank-redemption.jpg><p>If Driving Miss Daisy made Morgan someone you had to pay attention to, The Shawshank Redemption cemented Morgan as a truly legendary actor. The movie is seen as one of the best films of all time, and there hasn't been much that hasn't been said about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A neat little fun fact is that <a href=#>Kevin Costner was originally supposed to play Andy</a>, which is even more interesting now that Kevin and Morgan are about to work with each other. Kevin and Morgan are currently teaming up to bring a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Civil War TV show</a> to Paramount Plus.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What The Cast Of Shawshank Redemption Is Up To Now</a></span></p><p>According to ShowBizGalore, Morgan made only $300,000 from The Shawshank Redemption. It might seem a bit small, even when accounting for inflation. However, just like Driving Miss Daisy, it's a role that's less about money and more about artistic expression. And it was a wise decision too - this essentially unlocked Morgan to have any role he wanted from this point onward.</p><h2 id=se7en-was-a-risky-movie-for-morgan-freeman-and-brad-pitt><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Se7en Was A Risky Movie For Morgan Freeman And Brad Pitt</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/morgan-freeman-and-brad-pitt.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Se7en was a bit of a gamble for the two lead actors, Morgan and Brad Pitt. In hindsight, it was, once again, one of the best movies of all time. However, the movie had such a dark premise and ending. Morgan and Brad were the two biggest actors in the world at the time, and there was more risk than reward for accepting their roles. In addition, director David Fincher only had one film to his name before Se7en, and it was the much disliked Alien 3 movie.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Brad Pitt On Speaking Terms With All Of His Children?</a></span></p><p>To add to the risk, it seems the movie didn't pay much for its actors. If it flopped, Brad and Morgan weren't exactly making out like bandits to mitigate the risk. While there are no officially released salaries for the film, the movie had a budget of $30 million. Considering that the movie featured other stars in Kevin Spacey and Gwyneth Paltrow, as well as the fact there were many re-shoots, Morgan likely made at most a few million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bruce-almighty-paid-jim-carrey-and-morgan-freeman-a-lot-of-money><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Bruce Almighty Paid Jim Carrey And Morgan Freeman A Lot Of Money</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jim-Carrey.jpg><p>Jim Carrey was the protagonist of Bruce Almighty, while Morgan played the supporting role of God. Jennifer Aniston also starred in the film. Steve Carrell did too, and many people consider it to be his breakout role. Bruce Almighty might not be Morgan's best film, but it was a solid comedy that paid a lot of money. Morgan made over $10 million according to Cinebox.</p><p>According to The Things, Jim made $25 million for Bruce Almighty. Perhaps that's why <a href=#>Jim turned down a role in Pirates of the Caribbean</a>, which came out around the same time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=march-of-the-penguins-made-morgan-freeman-a-lot-of-money><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>March of the Penguins Made Morgan Freeman A Lot Of Money</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/families-of-penguins.jpg><p>March of the Penguins is a slightly forgotten film, largely in part due to its nature. It's a documentary about penguins, so yeah, it's not expected to be the most memorable film of all time. However, the film was really hot when it came out in 2005 and was really huge, despite being a French film about penguins. Maybe it's because of Morgan's narration. That's right, this movie was the peak of society's obsession with Morgan's charming and awesome voice.</p><p>According to Clutch Points, Morgan made around $1 million for his vocal performance. Not bad for a role that didn't involve any physical acting.</p><h2 id=the-bucket-list-fielded-mixed-reviews-despite-starring-morgan-freeman-and-jack-nicholson><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Bucket List Fielded Mixed Reviews Despite Starring Morgan Freeman And Jack Nicholson</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/morgan-freeman-and-jack-nicholson.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another forgotten film, this movie was slightly controversial when it came out.

Sure, the plot and acting would still be great, but Morgan's Lucius along with Michael Caine's Alfred served as wise mentors to the risk-taking Bruce Wayne. According to Answers, Morgan made $5 million for each Batman movie he starred in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The new Robert Pattinson Batman films may <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">avoid having Lucius</a> for one important reason - Morgan Freeman absolutely nailed his portrayal.
