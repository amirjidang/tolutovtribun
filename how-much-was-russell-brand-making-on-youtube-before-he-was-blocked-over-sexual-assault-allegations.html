That includes <strong><a href=#>Elon Musk</a></strong> and the internet's <a href=#>self-proclaimed misogynist, Andrew Tate</a> who was charged with rape and human trafficking in June 2023.</p><p>YouTube has recently demonetized Brand's channel amid the accusations. Here's a closer look at the British comic's lucrative guru evolution.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Russell Brand And Ricky Gervais Absolutely Roasted A Reporter During One of The Funniest Interviews Ever</a></span></p><h2 id=what-did-russell-brand-say-about-the-allegations-against-him>What Did Russell Brand Say About The Allegations Against Him?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/russell-brand-smiling.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brand has denied all the claims against him. "Amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute," he said in a statement. "These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream, when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies and, as I have written about extensively in my books, I was very, very promiscuous."</p><p>The <a href=#>Forgetting Sarah Marshall star</a>'s literary agency, Tavistock Wood — which initially denied allegations from one of the accusers in 2020 — has now dropped Brand from their talent roster. "Russell Brand categorically and vehemently denied the allegation made in 2020, but we now believe we were horribly misled by him. TW has terminated all professional ties to Brand," they said in a new statement, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">per Billboard</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An investigation has already started in the U.K., with the Metropolitan Police announcing: "We are aware of reporting by the Sunday Times and Channel 4's Dispatches about allegations of sexual offenses." They have "received a report of a sexual assault which was alleged to have taken place in Soho in central London in 2003. Officers are in contact with the woman and will be providing her with support."</p><p>Alan Collins, a lawyer and partner at Hugh James in London, said that Brand could be prosecuted in England as there are "no statute of limitations when it comes to sexual offenses" in the country. He added that in such cases, "judges tend to be disposed to disapply provided a fair trial is possible, and that means the evidence has not withered over time."

"The crimes he's been accused of are horrendous, and are damaging for him and for people were looking after him at the time," Borkowski explained, noting that the "unfettered unregulated world of social media" will keep Brand's fans on his side.</p><p>"He has an audience and lots and lots of people who are engaged in his content," the publicist said of the actor. "I think there will be a profound amount of people who will stand by him. Normally with allegations like this your career would be over, but not in this case, which is interesting. He's a great content generator. He didn't get to the top of his profession because he's mediocre. He has the power to bewitch his audience."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Borkowski also acknowledged that some people might see the scandal as an opportunity for themselves. "'There's a question whether he's going to face police action, but the question at the moment is of social media - the man isn't going to get a fair trial when the police have the evidence to prosecute him," he said of Brand's case. "More people may come forward, other people might see an opportunity. It's a very complex case, mixed between old media and social media."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Russell Brand's Interview On The View Took An Emotional Twist After Whoopi Goldberg Brought Up His Past Issues</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-does-russell-brand-make-off-youtube>How Much Does Russell Brand Make Off YouTube?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jpg_20230316_161006_0000-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortly after the accusations, YouTube suspended the monetization of Brand's channel. "This decision applies to all channels that may be owned or operated by Russell Brand," the platform stated. The BBC has also removed content featuring the online personality from its iPlayer and Sounds apps, "having assessed that it now falls below public expectations."</p><p>Sara McCorquodale, chief executive of the social media analysis agency CORQ, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a> that the Trew Era Cafe founder is most likely making £2,000 to £4,000 per video [on YouTube], not taking into account any affiliate deals and brand sponsorships that might be running in the background."</p><p>The alt-right content creator has an estimated net worth of $20 million (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">via Celebrity Net Worth</a>). Prior to his acting and internet fame, Brand started out as a stand-up comedian. He won fourth place in the Hackney Empire New Act of the Year competition in 2000. By 2006, he was doing a nationwide tour. He even performed for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip the following year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After embarking on his tour, Russell Brand: Only Joking that year, Comedy Central released Russell Brand in New York City, which shortly led to Brand's international tour. He also had DVDs of his performances: Russell Brand: Live (2006), Russell Brand: Doin' Life (2008), and Russell Brand: Messiah Complex (2013).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIywmKxloqrAtLHLpWSbqpGjsW65wKSgp59dpLtuxc6uq66alWKvprLOq5xmoJVixKK%2FjJujqJubmrFuu9WeqWarla3CoriMmqqsmaWhwW6ty6WcoJmknryvv44%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-was-russell-brand-making-on-youtube-before-he-was-blocked-over-sexual-assault-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-much-was-russell-brand-making-on-youtube-before-he-was-blocked-over-sexual-assault-allegations.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-was-russell-brand-making-on-youtube-before-he-was-blocked-over-sexual-assault-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-much-was-russell-brand-making-on-youtube-before-he-was-blocked-over-sexual-assault-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-was-russell-brand-making-on-youtube-before-he-was-blocked-over-sexual-assault-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-was-russell-brand-making-on-youtube-before-he-was-blocked-over-sexual-assault-allegations.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-wax-your-upper-lip-at-home.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-wax-your-upper-lip-at-home.html>How to wax your upper lip at home, according to the pros</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-much-money-does-taylor-nicole-earnhardt-make-latest-taylor-nicole-earnhardt-net-worth-income-salary.html>How Much Money Does Taylor Nicole Earnhardt Make?
