Cavill began his debut on the silver screen in the 2001 film Laguna and was followed by supporting roles in the star-studded 2002 feature adaptation film, The Count of Monte Cristo. Henry Cavill was very young when he came into the industry. He was only of twenty when he gained a starring role in I Capture the Castle in 2003.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Man of Steel star Henry Cavill tried to claim several high-profile roles in the film industry. Unfortunately, he didn’t get what he always wanted. For this, he was dubbed the unluckiest man in Hollywood for almost getting the role of James Bond and landed the role to the current James Bond actor, <a href=#>Daniel Craig</a>. But not too long, the tables were turned; he broke this statement when he got the prestigious role of becoming the new Superman, and the rest became history.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The 10 Lowest-Grossing Christopher Nolan Movies, Ranked" href=#>The 10 Lowest-Grossing Christopher Nolan Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=coming-from-an-athletic-background>Coming From An Athletic Background</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Henry William Dalgliesh Cavill was born in the Channel Islands, in the self-governing British Crown Dependency of Bailiwick of Jersey, on May 5, 1983. Henry was the fourth among the five siblings of his parents, Colin Cavill and Marianne Dalgliesh. His father was a former stockbroker, while his mother worked as a secretary in a bank. Henry took a private education at St. Michael’s Preparatory School in Sant Saviour in Jersey and went on after to Stowe School in Buckinghamshire in England.</p><p>Henry Cavill was active in sports and acting, and Cavill became interested in school plays at a very young age. In 1999, he joined the school production of the musical Grease by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey and played as a member of the T-Birds. Aside from diving into drama plays, Henry Cavill was also active in becoming an athlete. No wonder he has an incredible physique&nbsp;demanding&nbsp;muscular and rigid roles. He was a Rugby and Field Hockey player in his attending school in Stowe School. Momentarily, his school hosted a film shooting in a scene from Proof of Life, starring <a href=#>Russell Crowe</a>. As an aspiring actor, Henry walked between takes and introduced himself to the Gladiator star, asking how’s the life of being an actor and getting pocketful advice from Russell Crowe himself, without knowing that eleven years later, they would be cast together as Kal-El and Jor-El in Henry Cavill’s one of most breakthrough film, Man of Steel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=man-of-steel-before-the-flight>Man Of Steel: Before The Flight</h2><p>At his very young age, Henry Cavill, at seventeen, was discovered by the casting directors at his school who were looking for a fitting role of a young boy to play Albert Mondego in the film The Count of Monte Cristo. Henry got a supporting role in the 2002 film with actors Jim Caviezel, Richard Harris, Guy Pearce, and many more. Cavill’s first starring role in 2003 was the film I Capture the Castle, a romantic-drama film set in the 1930s in England where a seventeen-year-old girl Cassandra Mortmain, and the fortunes of her unconventional family struggle to survive in a decaying castle—followed by films that he got into Hellraiser: Hellworld in 2005, Red Riding Hood in 2006, and a minor role in the epic fantasy-adventure film Stardust in 2007, with cast members <a href=#>Sienna Miller</a> and Ben Barnes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following his milestones in minor film appearances, Cavill had a leading role in a television series titled The Tudors. He got a starring role in the series as the first Duke of Suffolk, Charles Brandon. The series became successful and got nominated in the 2007 Golden Globe Awards, and after a year, the series won an Emmy Award.</p><h2 id=henry-cavill-s-soaring-career>Henry Cavill’s Soaring Career</h2><p>Wearing the red cape wasn’t easy for Henry Cavill as he took off to the altitude of his career. He always aimed for the best he could be, but not all he desired. Mentioning earlier, when he knew he could handle things way better because acting valued him as a better man, he was one of the actors who auditioned and got missed the chance to play James Bond. Everyone knew this role was iconic, played by a handful of Hollywood icons. Unfortunately, he missed his chance to get the part. But he never knew what was coming up to fill up this lost-out opportunity. He’ll never know Daniel Craig, the current James Bond actor who looks like the 2020s James Bond film franchise, No Time to Die, will be his last, as reported, and Cavill is still open to getting the spot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, Cavill just stirred himself up to different roles and made himself more familiar with his other projects, and starred in various films, from Blood Creek in 2006 to Woody Allen’s comedy film Whatever Works in 2009. In this preparation, in 2011, it was publicly announced that Henry Cavill would be the next one to put the red cape on as the next Superman. While waiting for his big break, he starred in an underrated fantasy-adventure film, Immortals. Henry showed off his ripped figure in portraying the leading role of Theseus; well, that’s for a start. The irony is that Cavill was overweight growing up and hard to imagine as anything but ripped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zach Snyder, the director of <a href=#>Man of Steel</a>, stated that Cavill was the perfect choice to don the cape and the S shield. The entertainment media applauded Henry Cavill on his road to success for getting the most recognized and revered superhero character of all time. Cavill has never been more focused on wearing the red-bright S sign on his chest, as the surface was on almost the same level as picking a James Bond role. Henry Cavill’s Superman lasted for years, appearing in Snyder-related films to the character until its reported last cameo in the movie Dwayne Johnson’s Black Adam.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Man Of Steel: 10 Actors Who Played Superman" href=#>Man Of Steel: 10 Actors Who Played Superman</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Live About</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Famous People</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN Entertainment</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Looper</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gluwee</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">History Biography</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMrKypnaKirq951pqwZqCVp7K0eceormaglaO%2FunnCmq2ipJxir6avwKacZpldnbytuNiwpqicXaKyqK3SrZirZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-superman-way-heres-how-henry-cavill-became-a-hollywood-megastar.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-superman-way-heres-how-henry-cavill-became-a-hollywood-megastar.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-superman-way-heres-how-henry-cavill-became-a-hollywood-megastar.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-superman-way-heres-how-henry-cavill-became-a-hollywood-megastar.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-superman-way-heres-how-henry-cavill-became-a-hollywood-megastar.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-superman-way-heres-how-henry-cavill-became-a-hollywood-megastar.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-underground-mma-forum.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-underground-mma-forum.html>The Underground MMA Forum List of the Underground MMA Discussions and Forums</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./st-barths-nikki-beach-still-ultimate-boho-beach-club.html>St. Barth's Nikki Beach Still Ultimate Boho Beach Club</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./st-barths-nikki-beach-still-ultimate-boho-beach-club.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
