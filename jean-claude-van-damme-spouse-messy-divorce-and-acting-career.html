For over two decades, the rumors claimed the actor had an affair with the Australian pop star during filming of the 1994 movie in Thailand.</p><p>Van Damme became so annoyed at being asked about his relationship with Kylie Minogue, he would walk out of interviews when asked.

It would be abnormal not to have had an affair, she's so beautiful and she was there in front of me every day with a beautiful smile, simpatico, so charming. I knew Thailand very well, so I showed her my Thailand. She's a great lady."</p><p>Van Damme was married to his fourth wife, Darcy LaPier during the time of the affair. She apparently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">only learned of the affair when she read the interview.</a> "I was shocked he would talk to the press about this all these years later to gain some notoriety," she confirmed. "I didn't know about it, I have had my feelings hurt and I feel betrayed."</p><p>"There is a lot of water under the bridge between us, but the fact is I was pregnant with our son at the time.

Before being diagnosed, he would turn to martial arts training for help. "When I didn't train for a couple of days, I felt so low and nothing could make me happy."</p><p>Van Damme was finally diagnosed with Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder in 1998, and started taking a mood-stabilizing drug. "I didn't have any reasons to live ... I was not excited about anything. Then you have to find back your self-esteem. And then, slowly, every piece of yourself becomes precious again ... It's not the drugs, it's a problem with yourself, which you have to cure."</p><p>Whilst cleaning his life up and helping his career get back on track, he was helped by his ex-wife.

He struggled to not make direct contact with his co-stars during filming, reportedly knocking out his No Retreat, No Surrender costar, Peter Cunningham, twice.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He also left Predator after just two days</a>, where he was supposed to play the titular character. He was upset that he was a little more than a stuntman and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">couldn't do any of his martial arts on-screen.</a> This would have only been his second Hollywood role and something he begged the casting director for.</p><p>"My feet were in the cast of the alien. My hands were in the forearms, my head was in the neck. I was moving everything with cables. It was a very unsecure, very dangerous type of outfit."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The end result of his iconic villain looked much different originally. “They said I would be in a tight leotard with half-[human], half-animal makeup on my face,” Van Damme told Starlog magazine in 1989. So he was surprised that the end result looked much more different.</p><p>“I like to breathe — and they’re gonna do my head and everything,” the actor explained. “They put in my mouth like a tube [to breathe through]. I was covered in that cast for at least 20 minutes. It was boiling hot. My friend told me, ‘If you cannot breathe, just [wiggle] your finger and I’ll pull that stuff away from you.’ And I did it. I started to panic. And they go, ‘No! Five more minutes!'”</p><p>In all worked out for the actor as when he returned from filming in Mexico, he was offered a role in Bloodsport, his most iconic film role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnpmeYrCtrdSdnGaukaN6pa3Mppxmq6CkwrSxjKacrKupYrGqws6rmp5lkaOxbq3CraCnn12YrrOxxKtm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjean-claude-van-damme-spouse-messy-divorce-and-acting-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjean-claude-van-damme-spouse-messy-divorce-and-acting-career.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjean-claude-van-damme-spouse-messy-divorce-and-acting-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjean-claude-van-damme-spouse-messy-divorce-and-acting-career.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjean-claude-van-damme-spouse-messy-divorce-and-acting-career.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjean-claude-van-damme-spouse-messy-divorce-and-acting-career.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./this-is-what-fans-really-think-about-netflixs-season-3-of-you.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./this-is-what-fans-really-think-about-netflixs-season-3-of-you.html>This Is What Fans Really Think About Netflix's Season 3 Of 'You'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./hannah-brown-boyfriend-adam-woolard-bacherlorette-safe-dating.html>The Real Reason Hannah Brown Is Dating Adam Woolard</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./hannah-brown-boyfriend-adam-woolard-bacherlorette-safe-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
