I don’t think I’m the drama. Maybe I’m the drama.”</strong></p><p>Christine added: <strong>“Yeah, I live for it. I love being the villain and I wouldn’t have it any other way.”</strong></p><p>While fans agree that Christine is perhaps less manipulative than Davina Portraz, it is clear she adores stirring the proverbial pot.</p><p>In season 4, it seemed that the Selling Sunset ladies just had to add fuel to an already chaotic fire.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Christine’s Traumatic Season 4 Experience</strong></h2><p>Christine opened up about suffering from postpartum depression during the filming of Selling Sunset’s fourth season.</p><p><strong>“I was pregnant on top of dealing with postpartum depression … this season was really difficult for me,”</strong> she <a href=#>said</a>.<strong> “I did the best that I could with the emotions that I was dealing with at the time and that I’m still dealing with now.”</strong></p><p>Quinn also came under fire after coworkers and viewers questioned her ability to gain her supermodel body right after she gave birth.</p><p>Christine revealed that she heard medical staff declare she needed an emergency C-section to save the baby during the difficult labor.</p><p>She also revealed that her husband was told to choose between his wife or son amidst the chaos.</p><p><strong>“[Christian] was absolutely freaking out. And then when we were doing the emergency C-section, my heart rate was going down, the baby’s heart rate was going down,” </strong>Christine told her colleagues on the show.<strong> “And then one of the nurses went up to Christian and said, ‘You need to make a priority right now. You have to choose one.’ He was like, ‘Both. You need… Both.’”</strong></p><p>Despite the show she has experienced as a new mother, Christine has had to fight rumors of faking her pregnancy online.</p><p>She revealed in a confessional that she wanted to maintain her physical health during her pregnancy, keeping her body active through yoga and pilates.</p><p>Accusations that she fabricated the entire pregnancy began to circulate after clips of the show in which Christine was being complimented on her post-baby body went viral.</p><p>In response to a scene that made it look like Christine was doing yoga after having just given birth, she revealed it had been edited to look that way.</p><p>According to Christine, the editors intentionally made it seem as though she was post-partum while she was exercising while pregnant.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“I never worked out after my C-section,” </strong>she replied to a user on <a href=#>Twitter</a>.<strong> “Are you smoking Crack? Where did you read that? The yoga scene I was pregnant. It took me 4 months till I could even start yoga again.”</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, it seems as though Netflix took advantage of Christine’s fragile state when editing the series, painting her as a negligent mother and friend.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvx6ugrKyZo7JuvdSipadlo6nCr7%2BO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchristine-quinn-stuns.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchristine-quinn-stuns.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchristine-quinn-stuns.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchristine-quinn-stuns.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchristine-quinn-stuns.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchristine-quinn-stuns.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./elisabeth-rohms-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./elisabeth-rohms-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Elisabeth Rhms Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./brittny-gastineau-net-worth.html>Brittny Gastineau Net Worth How Much is Brittny Gastineau Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./brittny-gastineau-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
