She is now one of the most successful musicians of all time and the most streamed female artists in the world, which is one of the reasons she was chosen to be a judge on The Voice. She started on Broadway and <a href=#>soon found herself working for Nickelodeon</a>, and ever since her television debut she has evolved <a href=#>into an international superstar.</a> Since leaving Nickelodeon for the big time in the early 2010s, her career has been a massive success and she just produces hit after hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Really Want Pete Davidson To Still Be In Love With Ariana Grande</a></span></p><p>That said, even the most successful of artists can’t win them all. Even though all of her albums have sold incredibly well, some have sold better than others. Her earliest albums have grossly outsold her newest work. Also, some of Ariana Grande’s albums and EPs are only available in a few countries, which would of course minimize their sales numbers. What is the worst-selling album this young diva has given to the world? Well, depending on how one analyzes the sales, it was either Positions (her 2020 album) or, it was a remix album that only sold a few copies in Japan.</p><h2 id=lsquo-yours-truly-rsquo-launched-ariana-grande-to-stardom><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>‘Yours Truly’ Launched Ariana Grande To Stardom</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ariana Grande’s rise started when she was on the Nickelodeon show Victorious, which only lasted 3 years but was still a huge success. In 2013, riding the wave of her newfound fame, she released Yours Truly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which sold over 600,000 copies in the United States alone</a>. But it would be her next album that would earn her a permanent place as a diva and international star. Hit tracks on Yours Truly include “Baby I,” “Right There,” and “The Way,” which she recorded with her then-boyfriend Mac Miller.</p><h2 id=her-second-album-lsquo-my-everything-rsquo-quickly-outsold-lsquo-yours-truly-rsquo><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Her Second Album ‘My Everything’ Quickly Outsold ‘Yours Truly’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yours Truly sold 600,000 copies in the states and around 700,000 - 900,000 worldwide. My Everything, her second studio album, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quickly outpaced that and sold 700,000 in the US alone</a>. Tracks on the album include hits like “One Last Time,” “Bang Bang,” and “Problem” (which she co-recorded with Iggy Azalea). The album was a Billboard chart topper in the United States and several other countries.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Don't Look Up' Creator Adam McKay Revealed Ariana Grande Completely Improvised This Memorable Scene</a></span></p><h2 id=lsquo-dangerous-woman-rsquo-was-ariana-grande-rsquo-s-first-album-to-not-hit-1-in-the-us><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>‘Dangerous Woman’ Was Ariana Grande’s First Album To Not Hit #1 In The US</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ariana Grande’s 3rd album, Dangerous Woman, came out in 2016, and it was the album where Grande stepped away from the more poppy, almost childlike songs and embraced a more mature kind of sound. In a way, this album marks her conversion from starlet to diva. However, this was the first of Ariana Grande’s albums not to hit number 1 on the US sales charts. However, it only fell to second place in the US and was still the number 1 album sold in Australia, Italy, Norway, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Also, several of the tracks are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">now certified platinum tracks</a> in the United States,</p><h2 id=lsquo-sweetener-rsquo-was-the-1-album-in-at-least-8-countries><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>‘Sweetener’ Was The #1 Album In At Least 8 Countries</span></h2><p>Although it sold less in the US than her previous albums, barely crossing over 300,000 copies, it was still number one on the US charts, and it was arguably Ariana Grande's fastest selling album and the biggest fan favorite. Sweetener was the number one album of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2018 in the United States, Australia, Canada, Italy, Norway, New Zealand, Sweden, and England</a>. It was also one of her best-selling albums to ever be released in Japan, moving over 28,000 copies there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ariana Grande Completely Embarrassed An Interviewer During A Live Radio Show</a></span></p><h2 id=lsquo-positions-rsquo-only-sold-200-000-copies><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>‘Positions’ Only Sold 200,000 Copies</span></h2><p>Ariana Grande’s latest album was her 2020 release Positions, and it is unquestionably <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her lowest selling studio album</a> to date, but it is not her worst selling album overall (see below). Despite having hit tracks like “POV” and “34+35” on it, Positions just did not move as many copies as her earliest work did. But, this could be more of a reflection on the economy of 2020 than a reflection of Ariana Grande’s talent. 2020 was a tumultuous year because of the COVID-19 pandemic and several industries saw a downturn in sales, including the music industry. People were not eager to spend money on albums, or anything really, that year because of massive economic uncertainty, a lot of people lost a lot of money and work that year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lsquo-k-bye-for-now-rsquo-only-sold-4-000-copies><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>‘K, Bye For Now’ Only Sold 4,000 Copies</span></h2><p>Ariana Grande’s worst selling album, technically speaking, is her live album K Bye for Now which was the live recording of the tracks she sang on her Sweetener World Tour. The album only ranked as the 79th best-selling album in the United States the year it came out with only <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">4,000 copies sold</a>. Perhaps fans just prefer her studio albums to her live tracks? Who knows? Either way, this album did not sell nearly as well as any other album with Ariana Grande's name on it. The live album was released in 2019.</p><h2 id=ariana-grande-39-s-remix-album-was-only-sold-in-japan><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Ariana Grande's Remix Album Was Only Sold In Japan</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lastly, a 2015 remix album was put out by Universal Music but was only available in Japan. The remix sold approximately 1,500 copies. Also, Universal Music Japan released a compilation album in 2017 titled The Best, which sold around 23,000 copies.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Ariana Grande And Her Husband Were Involved In A Scandal That Fans Didn’t Even Know About</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecCroJqmkWK0s63NnZxmr5%2BnwLV50p6jpaGenHqiuMGupGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-ariana-grande-worst-selling-album.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-ariana-grande-worst-selling-album.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-ariana-grande-worst-selling-album.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-ariana-grande-worst-selling-album.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-ariana-grande-worst-selling-album.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-ariana-grande-worst-selling-album.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-are-hassie-harrison-yellowstone-laramie-actress-parents-611299-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-are-hassie-harrison-yellowstone-laramie-actress-parents-611299-html.html>Who Are Hassie Harrison Yellowstone Laramie Actress Parents?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./victoria-rowell-bio-wiki-age-parents-sisters-husband-daughter-son-net-worth-height-movies-and-tv-shows.html>Victoria Rowell Bio, Wiki, Age, Parents, Sisters, Husband, Daughter, Son, Net worth, Height, Movies</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./victoria-rowell-bio-wiki-age-parents-sisters-husband-daughter-son-net-worth-height-movies-and-tv-shows.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
