CGI in the film industry had started to gain traction, some of the best music was released, and there were plenty of interesting and weird toys that children could buy. Some of the greatest movies, like Pulp Fiction, Titanic, and The Matrix also came out during this period. At the time, the world had advanced tremendously in technology. Cellular phones, color television, and live television were becoming norms, and the World Wide Web was starting strong. Plus, the infant mortality rate had dropped almost 90%!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, however, not everything was perfect. The 90s came after a time when drugs were everywhere, and the world was still thawing after The Cold War. It was also the time the Gulf War began. And death, the one thing that all humans will have in common, definitely wasn't taking a break during this decade. Due to drugs, wars, gang violence, and natural causes, death kept taking and taking like it always has. And, of course, celebrities were no exception. A lot of influential people died during this decade -- some of natural causes, some by drug overdoses, and a few even by homicide.</p><p>These are some of the 15 celebrities who died in the 1990s.</p><h2 id=princess-diana-august-31st-1997><strong>Princess Diana (August 31st, 1997)</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Diana</a> was the first wife of <a href=#>Charles</a>, the Prince of Wales, and a prominent figure in the British Royal Family.

She bore two sons, <a href=#>William</a> and <a href=#>Harry</a>, and was married to Charles until their divorce in 1996. Diana was very active in charities involving AIDS and cancer, just to name a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On August 31st, 1997, the world was shocked to hear that Diana had died in a car accident. The driver, Henri Paul, and Diana's partner, Dodi Fayed, also died in the crash. There were many theories as to how the crash occurred, ranging from Paul being inebriated behind the wheel to an actual assassination. To this day, Diana's image still influences the royal family.</p><h2 id=tupac-shakur-september-13th-1996><strong>Tupac Shakur (September 13th, 1996)</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Tupac Shakur</a> is considered one of the most influential and greatest rappers of his generation -- and of all time.

Shakur started his career in the arts at the age of twelve, later on enrolling in the Baltimore School of the Arts. Shakur was engaged to Kidada Jones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On September 7th of 1996, Shakur was caught in a drive-by shooting by an individual in a white Cadillac.

A month later, around March 9th, a man in a black Chevy Impala pulled up to B.I.G.'s vehicle and shot him four times in the chest. B.I.G. was rushed to the hospital, where he later died of his wounds.

Ross was married to Jane Ross, who died in 1993, and together, they had three children.</p><p>In the early 90s, Ross was diagnosed with lymphoma.

Henson was married to Jane Nebel and had five children.</p><p>On May 16th, 1990, Henson had passed away due to toxic shock syndrome. Some, his mother included, believed that his Christian Science-based faith might have contributed to the puppeteer's death. A few days before his death, Henson was coughing up blood and had trouble breathing. When asked to go to the hospital, he refused.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kurt-cobain-april-5th-1994><strong>Kurt Cobain (April 5th, 1994)</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kurt Cobain</a> was the lead singer of Nirvana, their song Smells Like Teen Spirit being their most recognizable.
