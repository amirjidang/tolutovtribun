Many people don't fully understand schizophrenia and are afraid to explore the details of the condition. Like many psychological conditions, schizophrenia can range in terms of intensity, and affects people in different ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People who have schizophrenia can exhibit minor characteristics like being forgetful and disorganized. Some can display symptoms that are much more serious, such as being delusional and listening to voices in their head that encourage them to harm others. Unfortunately, some criminals have committed horrible acts as a result of this mental condition. It is also important to note that multiple personality disorder is different from schizophrenia, although the two conditions are often viewed as the same disease. Also, contrary to popular opinion, schizophrenia isn't exactly an uncommon condition. HelpGuide.org suggests that about 1 in 100 people will develop schizophrenia at some point in their lives.</p><p>Medical advances make it possible for people with schizophrenia to live happy and fulfilling lives. Some individuals are able to have healthy family relationships and professional success. Treatments can include medication, counseling and a host of exercises and activities that are designed to recondition the brain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These ten well-known&nbsp;schizophrenics all suffered to different degrees; some managed to go on to live fulfilling lives while obtaining treatment, while others' lives were irrevocably led down dangerous paths and they became tragically defined by the illness.</p><h2 id=wesley-willis>10.
