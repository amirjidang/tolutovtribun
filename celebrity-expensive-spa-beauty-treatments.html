Sounds like a miracle treatment, right?</p><p>There are products in different price ranges. However, the most potent treatment is available in specialized clinics. They use purified snail slime from a farm in Spain, combined with tiny needles. It makes the product penetrate deeper into the skin and is more effective than home treatments. Each session costs $350.</p><h2 id=real-24k-gold-mask---up-to-400>Real 24k Gold Mask - up to $400</h2><p>Gold is not only suitable for jewelry.

Perhaps the answer is ten people giving you a massage. The Grand Wailea Resort in Maui decided to celebrate its 20th anniversary by offering their clients a new service. However, the price for this luxury is high: $2,000 for a 50-minute massage.</p><p>According to the resort, the masseuses are trained to give a perfect simultaneous massage and it is a uniquely relaxing experience.

The specialist will take a sample of your blood, remove the liquid part and put it back on your face using needles.

The cones then grab hold of the skin from the undersurface and pull to re-suspend the skin in a lifted more youthful position."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The thread lift is less invasive than the regular lift.
