The Better Now singer has made a name for himself after decades of working in the entertainment industry. The <a href=#>Apocalypse-Proof Utah bunker</a> owner began his music career around 2011 and he only gained recognition after he released his debut single White Iverson in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to his debut song peaking at number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100, he was able to gain fame and has since stayed in the music industry. Today he was able to accumulate a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $45 million</a> which let him buy whatever he wants including a massive car collection. Take a look at the singer's massive and expensive car collection.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="A Peek Inside The Massive Car Collection Of The Rainbow Sheikh" href=#>A Peek Inside The Massive Car Collection Of The Rainbow Sheikh</a></span></p><h2 id=bugatti-chiron>Bugatti Chiron</h2><p>Bugatti prides itself with Chiron and claims that Chiron is their fastest and most powerful super sports car in Bugatti's history. The car costs around $150,000 and said to be one of the most expensive and exclusive hypercar. Post Malone owns an all white on white 2019 Bugatti Chiron in his collection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The car can get upgrade like some silver mesh front grill, with black brake calipers and silver Caractere alloy wheels in addition to an all-white leather interior.</p><h2 id=ford-gt>Ford GT</h2><p>Post Malone seems to love cars in white color since he also owns a white-coloured 2021 Ford GT. Just a few months before Ford finally decided to stop the production of this sleek supercar, Post Malone also decided to own one. This is probably <a href=#>one of the craziest things Post Malone bought</a> and Ford GT costs around $500,000 and it performs like a Le Mans winner.</p><p>The second generation Ford GT that was released in 2016 as a super elusive two seater, two door and low slung car. It has been among the most popular choice among the wealthiest people in the planet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lamborghini-aventador-sv-roadster>Lamborghini Aventador SV Roadster</h2><p>The Lamborghini Aventador SV LP 750-4 Roadster only remained on sale for a short period of time from 2016 until 2017 only. It was reported that only 500 units were sold of the exclusive convertible version of the Aventador during this time. Post Malone is one of the lucky man who was able to buy one of those 500 exclusively made cars and it sits right at his car collection.</p><p>His Lamborghini Aventador SV Roadster was customized by the Los Angeles-based R1 Motorsport to add on some a carbon fibre kit from the Novitec. It was reported that a Lamborghini Aventador SV Roadster retailed at $530,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hennessey-velociraptor-6-6>Hennessey VelociRaptor 6×6</h2><p>Hennessey VelociRaptor 6×6 is considered to be the ultimate Ford Raptor made in the most American way possible. This car is made to be bigger, taller, longer and utilizes more power. It is a Ford Raptor giving out a bolder statement on the road. The monster truck should have been featured at <a href=#>the film Ford v Ferrari</a> since it was heavily refined and modified to fit the American standard.</p><p>Hennessey VelociRaptor 6×6 has a higher ground clearance and is powered with a 3.5-litre turbocharged V6 petrol engine that can deliver a maximum power output of 600 PS. The price of one Hennessey VelociRaptor 6×6 is about $400,000.</p><h2 id=ford-shelby-f-150-super-snake>Ford Shelby F-150 Super Snake</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Ford Shelby F-150 Super Snake is probably one of the cheapest car on Post Malone's collection since it retails for $105,130. Despite it's relatively cheaper price, the Shelby GT500 is among the craziest stock Ford car. The two door truck is the equivalent of the Mustang based GT500.</p><p>It can be said that it is the perfect tribute car to the founder of Shelby, Carroll Shelby. Ford Shelby F-150 Super Snake is one of the most exclusive cars added to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the car collection of Post Malone.</a></p><h2 id=rolls-royce-phantom>Rolls Royce Phantom</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Rolls Royce Phantom is the pinnacle of the Phantom Series and is a legendary maverick on the road. The Phantom is not just any other car, it can be a symbol of pride and prestige en voyage. Just like the other Post Malone cars, the musician owns a white Phantom car and is said to be a replacement for the other Rolls Royce car in his collection.</p><p>The musician totaled his Rolls Royce Wraith and he decided to replace it with a Rolls Royce Phantom instead. The Phantom in the rapper's collection is a long-wheelbase Rolls Royce Phantom VIII which is the eighth generation model of the luxurious sedan.&nbsp; This is probably one of <a href=#>the most expensive things Post Malone bought</a> since one Rolls Royce Phantom costs around $460,000.</p><h2 id=rolls-royce-cullinan>Rolls Royce Cullinan</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rolls Royce Cullinan is the first ever SUV from the luxury car brand Rolls Royce. Unlike the other white colored luxury cars on the rapper's collection, his Rolls Royce Cullinan is a Black Badge Edition. Post Malone's Cullinan is finished in the shade of black and he got a custom neon yellow interior for this car. The car looks like a regal London taxi that has an elegant interior.</p><p>It was reported that the rapper once raced using his Rolls Royce Cullinan with a fleet of NASCAR stock cars while he was at the Auto Club Speedway in California. One Rolls Royce Cullinan is selling at around $350,000 and some even higher with the add ons and customization.</p><h2 id=subaru-wrx>Subaru WRX</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As someone who's had a flamboyant personality, one may not imagine Post Malone owning a Subaru WRX. Compared to the other cars in the rapper's collection, the Subaru WRX is somewhat different since it is just a regular looking four door sedan, far from the luxurious and elegant look of the other cars in Post Malone's car collection.</p><p>This is probably the cheapest car in his collection since a Subaru WRX only retails at around $35,000. Post Malone might have fell in love with the car's fun, and easy drivability. The Subaru WRX that Post Malone owns is a black colored that's finished with a shade of Crystal White Pearl. The four door Japanese car is powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine which results to a 350 Nm of torque and 270 PS of power.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="A Peek Inside Rick Ross’ Exquisite Car Collection" href=#>A Peek Inside Rick Ross’ Exquisite Car Collection</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Car Bike India</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Car Blondie</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot Cars</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMq6aco6OprrN5xpqpmp%2BVYq5uvMSeomahnqi2pbGMqaasrF2irq27zZ6qZpuRp3qku8ulnJysmaS7cA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-rockstar-garage-a-peek-inside-post-malones-car-collection.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-rockstar-garage-a-peek-inside-post-malones-car-collection.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-rockstar-garage-a-peek-inside-post-malones-car-collection.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-rockstar-garage-a-peek-inside-post-malones-car-collection.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-rockstar-garage-a-peek-inside-post-malones-car-collection.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-rockstar-garage-a-peek-inside-post-malones-car-collection.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tiffiney-crawfords-mysterious-case-was-the-shooting-death-ruled-a-suicide-or-murder-605538-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tiffiney-crawfords-mysterious-case-was-the-shooting-death-ruled-a-suicide-or-murder-605538-html.html>Tiffiney Crawfords mysterious case: Was the shooting death ruled a suicide or murder?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-most-expensive-clothing-jewelry-worn-by-beyonce-ranked.html>The Most Expensive Clothing &amp;amp; Jewelry Worn By Beyonce, Ranked</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-most-expensive-clothing-jewelry-worn-by-beyonce-ranked.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
