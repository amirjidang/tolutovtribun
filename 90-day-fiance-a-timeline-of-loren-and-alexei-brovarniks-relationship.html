The pair haven't always had the easiest timeline, what with awaiting citizenship approval and convincing Loren's family that Alexei is right for Loren, but these obstacles didn't stop them from believing in each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What began as a Birthright trip would soon become so much more, as Loren gave up her home, career, and lifestyle. Alexei made the decision to leave his country and his career as a medic. They both made sacrifices for the chance at something real and everlasting, and their belief in love is how they became&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé's sweetest couples</a>.</p><h2 id=birthright-the-moment-they-met><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Birthright: The Moment They Met</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/loren-and-alexei-.jpg><p>Loren and Alexei met while she was on a Birthright trip, something anyone with confirmed Jewish heritage is permitted to take prior to a certain age.
