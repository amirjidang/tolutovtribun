Here’s why.</p><h2 id=what-has-mariah-carey-said-about-alison>What Has Mariah Carey Said About Alison?</h2><p>While fans were aware that Alison has sold her sibling out to the press on a handful of occasions in the past, despite having also received “hundreds of thousands of dollars” from the singer before their relationship turned sour, nobody understood what actually led Carey to keep her distance for good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Oprah Winfrey for Apple TV's The Oprah Conversation, Carey opened up about her longtime feud with Alison and their brother, Morgan, recalling moments she felt like she was an “ATM machine with a wig on” to her family.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariah Carey Gets Emotional While Promoting The Release Of ‘The Meaning Of Mariah Carey’</a></span></p><p>Even early on in her career, MC says she was betrayed and mistreated by Morgan and Alison, which have made her now refer to them as “ex-sister” and “ex-brother” for the simple fact that she could never see herself making amends with either of them.</p><p>"Here’s the thing: They have been ruthlessly just heartless in terms of dealing with me as a human being for most of my life. I never would have spoken about my family at all had they not done it first.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She further mentioned to Winfrey that while she forgives both of them for the way that they treated her, she doesn’t want anything to do with her siblings, who she describes as “broken” people.</p><p>"I have forgiveness in my heart, and so I forgive them, but I am not trying to invite anybody to come hang out over here. I think they’re very broken, and I feel sad for them.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariah Carey Fans Finally Understand Why She Doesn’t Help Her Homeless Sister</a></span></p><p>Their rivalry stemmed from the fact that Morgan and Alison felt as if Carey had a much easier life than they did - even before she became a worldwide household name, they thought she was favored over them, which the 'Shake It Off' chart-topper strongly denies.</p><p>In her memoir, The Meaning of Mariah Carey, she explained: "Alison and Morgan both believed I had it easier than they did.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also accused Alison of drugging her, offering her cocaine on multiple occasions, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inflicting her with burns at the age of 12 </a>-&nbsp;while she continued to forgive her sibling for her torturous actions, it was in her adult years where Carey realized how their toxic had affected her mental wellbeing.</p><p>There were many family&nbsp;blowups between the trio when Carey became a global superstar before Alison and Morgan would make it a habit of talking to the press about private matters concerning their sister's private life, which sealed the deal for the songstress on where her relationship stood with either of them moving forward.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Jermaine Dupri Saved Mariah Carey’s Music Career</a></span></p><p>Alison, who became seriously ill and suffered from brain damage after a home invasion attack in 2015, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has begged Carey for forgiveness for the things she’s done</a>, but it appears as if Carey is unwilling to budge - especially since she’s spent a fortune helping her sister get back on her feet, only to relapse and trash her in any way she could.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Through the years, Mariah has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars supporting Alison and her children,” a rep for Carey told Daily Mail in 2018. “In fact, Mariah has supported her extended family for over two decades.”</p><p>But it’s not just Alison and Morgan who Carey has faced plenty of ups-and-downs with over the years. The 50-year-old continued telling Winfrey during their interview that fans would be surprised to hear about her relationship with her mother, Patricia, which has also been fractured for decades.</p><p>"I tried to make her feel like I really do think she did the best she could,” she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I cried writing a lot of parts of this book. Maybe it’s because I have such vivid recollections. You know what? I’m sure I’m going to have to deal with a lot of people being upset with me. I hope not.”</p><p>While Carey is still on speaking terms with her mother, though she says it’s a difficult relationship between the two, neither one of them has been in contact with either Morgan or Alison.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Halle Berry And Mariah Carey Demand Answers 6 Months After Breonna Taylor’s Death</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrCiwdKem2asmJp6sLrGqKCnn12bsrawjJucra%2BVmrtuucCroJqgXZius7HYZpinnF2dsrN5xKyrq5menLKledKiqq2domKurbXSqKVo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-caused-the-ongoing-feud-between-mariah-carey-and-her-estranged-sister-alison.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-caused-the-ongoing-feud-between-mariah-carey-and-her-estranged-sister-alison.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-caused-the-ongoing-feud-between-mariah-carey-and-her-estranged-sister-alison.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-caused-the-ongoing-feud-between-mariah-carey-and-her-estranged-sister-alison.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-caused-the-ongoing-feud-between-mariah-carey-and-her-estranged-sister-alison.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-caused-the-ongoing-feud-between-mariah-carey-and-her-estranged-sister-alison.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-happen-mia-goths-eyebrows-is-it-natural-learn-about-actress-makeup-style.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-happen-mia-goths-eyebrows-is-it-natural-learn-about-actress-makeup-style.html>What Happen Mia Goths Eyebrows?
