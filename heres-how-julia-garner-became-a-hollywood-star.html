She is known for her role as a member of a family of petty criminals in Netflix’s hit drama series Ozark. Julia started her career by co-starred with <a href=#>Lily Tomlin</a> in the independent film Grandma.&nbsp;Julia was praised for her golden aura, so rare and so retro. In 2011, she went to play for her first role as a cult initiate in another independent film titled Martha Marcy May Marlene. A year after, in a movie titled Electrick Children, where her role as a pregnant Mormon teen leaves a repressive religious colony because she thinks a song is responsible for her pregnancy.

She is known for her famous shows on Netflix, Inventing Anna and Ozark, which won her two&nbsp;<a href=#>Emmy awards</a> for Outstanding Supporting Actress for her role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her salary in Ozark has not yet been confirmed, but it was estimated that she makes around the same amount as her co-stars. According to Variety news, Ozark co-stars Jason Bateman, who plays Marty Byrde, and Laura Linney, who plays Wendy Byrde.&nbsp;The two made $300,000 per episode as of 2017. If their salary remained the same, their rate would’ve paid them $3 million for ten episodes. That would’ve made them earn at least $13.2 million for all seasons of the Ozark.</p><p>Including the show’s nominations for Outstanding Drama Series in 2019 and 2020, it’s assumed that the show and the actors made even more after its success on world television. Julia Garner’s net worth is $3 million.&nbsp;Not the same amount as her co-stars, given that Garner is a supporting actor for lead actors Bateman and Linney, which makes her close to what she was earning but not the same amount. Being the only cast member to win two Emmy awards alone from her role in Ozark, Julia Garner’s estimated salary from the show is at least six figures per episode which would’ve paid her millions by the time the series ended 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="8 TV Shows Netflix Paid For A Fortune To Stream" href=#>8 TV Shows Netflix Paid For A Fortune To Stream</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Imdb</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheFamousPeople</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGentleWoman</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheWikiFeed</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marca</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stylecaster</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1pr7ErGShp6dit7a4yJpkoJmio7KzecGempqllWKubrTOpaOyr5%2BksW6%2F05qpaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-how-julia-garner-became-a-hollywood-star.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheres-how-julia-garner-became-a-hollywood-star.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheres-how-julia-garner-became-a-hollywood-star.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheres-how-julia-garner-became-a-hollywood-star.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-how-julia-garner-became-a-hollywood-star.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-how-julia-garner-became-a-hollywood-star.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-pronounce-melancholic-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-pronounce-melancholic-2.html>How to pronounce melancholic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./heath-hussar-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-129462-html.html>Heath Hussar Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./heath-hussar-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-129462-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
