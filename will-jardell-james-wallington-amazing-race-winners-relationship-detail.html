As such, every time someone finds true love, it is particularly intriguing, especially when they are famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Will Jardell and James Wallington have been in the media for quite some time, even before they got on The Amazing Race, but that was what put them directly in the public eye. Since then, fans have been following their love story closely, and we do say, it’s been quite the ride for the pair. Here’s how far they’ve come.</p><h2 id=how-will-jardell-and-james-wallington-met><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Will Jardell And James Wallington Met</span></h2><p>Looking back at things now, it is highly unlikely that Will Jardell and James Wallington had even the slightest inkling that things would go this far. They met back in 2014 while the filming of America’s Next Top Model was underway. At the time, Wallington was actually working on set, while Jardell was a runner-up at the event. According to the pair, they hit it off almost immediately and got to talking, and from then on, it was just one adventure to another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Is ‘The Amazing Race’ Host, Phil Keoghan Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=will-and-james-love-traveling><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Will And James Love Traveling</span></h2><p>One of the most endearing things about Will Jardell and James Wallington is their love for traveling. It later became a full-time job for them, as they were filming their adventures and putting out content, which was their first step into gaining recognition.</p><p>“Our very first trip together was to New York City, and it was probably the worst trip I think either of us ever had,” Jardell recalled in an interview. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything that could’ve gone wrong went wrong. </a>We had to move to three different locations to spend the night, it was 17 degrees, we had three massive suitcases going around New York City in the snow! [But] we worked really well together.” Because of this foundation, it wasn’t very shocking that they landed on a reality show centered around that concept.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-jardell-and-james-wallington-39-s-39-amazing-race-39-adventure><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Will Jardell And James Wallington's 'Amazing Race' Adventure</span></h2><p>A few years after Will Jardell and James Wallington officially started going out, the pair decided to get on The Amazing Race, a reality show where participants race each other around the world while touching down in different countries for the grand prize. The event marked a significant milestone in their lives and relationships. This wasn't only because they won the competition and by extension the $1 million grand prize, Will Jardell also proposed to James Wallington, and they sealed their engagement with a kiss on the mat at the Amazing Race finish line in New Orleans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the newly engaged couple, it was a pretty amazing experience because they’d been watching the show since they were kids. While speaking in an interview, Jardell stated, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">That became our outlet as young people to see real people living out their truth</a>. So for us to be able to run the race as a gay couple – for the show to never mention that we’re gay, to just refer to us as a dating couple – was huge. And then to end the season with us winning and then also getting engaged was massive for the show to showcase that.”</p><h2 id=will-jardell-and-james-wallington-39-s-39-amazing-race-39-experience-was-a-win-for-the-lgbtq-community><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Will Jardell And James Wallington's 'Amazing Race' Experience Was A Win For The LGBTQ+ Community</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While on the show and even after the show, Will and James have stated that they have been repeatedly reached out to by queer teens, parents, and adults in general about how much of a difference their time on the show meant for the LGBTQ+ community. And even though they aren’t the first gay couple on the show, or even the first to ever win, they believe that the demographic has changed significantly in their time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Are The Richest 'Amazing Race' Contestants Ever</a></span></p><p>While speaking in an interview, Jardell and Wallington said, “I think a huge leap forward for unscripted TV is the fact that not once during the show did they ever have to refer to us as ‘gay.’” Jardell muses now, “They only referred to us as ‘dating’ or ‘boyfriends,’ and I think that was massive. A different demographic watches The Amazing Race, and so they’re able to see a loving couple who they might not normally see in their day-to-day lives.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-jardell-and-james-wallington-39-s-wedding><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Will Jardell And James Wallington's Wedding</span></h2><p>Will Jardell and James Wallington, while they had been engaged since their Amazing Race win, the pair decided to make things official on the third of December 2021. “This moment has been a long time coming, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s such a relief to FINALLY be married and call ourselves husbands</a>,” the couple tells US Weekly. “The best part is having everyone we love in the same space to be a part of this special moment. It’s going to take some getting used to saying ‘my husband’!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The event took place at the New Orleans Athletic Club and of course, the guest space was filled with their family members, as well as most of their co-stars. Even though a few hiccups almost came down the line, the wedding was amazing for both the guests and the couple themselves. While speaking on the event, the couple told US Weekly, “We knew it was the right thing in order to eventually celebrate safely with our loved ones."</p><p>“We think it all worked out the way it was always meant to be because the date all our vendors were available was December 3, which after thinking back on it, happened to be the exact date we crossed The Amazing Race finish line in New Orleans and got engaged. We couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out and can’t thank our vendors enough for being flexible with us over this past year.”</p><h2 id=a-new-chapter-for-will-jardell-and-james-wallington><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>A New Chapter For Will Jardell And James Wallington</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After officially getting hitched, Will Jardell and James Wallington appear to be pretty excited about the next chapters of their lives.

Only a month after saying their "I do's," the pair hopped on the Santa Cruz II to be part of its maiden voyage.</p><p>"We've always been passionate about eco-friendly and sustainable tourism," said Wallington. "It's very important to us because we love this planet and its endless travel opportunities, so we want to make sure we do our part to protect it all while continuing to experience its natural wonders!"
