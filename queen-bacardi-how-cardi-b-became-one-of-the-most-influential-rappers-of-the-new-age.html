Her no-filter commentary about different topics has made her one of the industry's most entertaining and relatable celebrities. She has hustled for many years to have a positive career trajectory. Cardi B has <a href=#>had an interesting life story</a>, from working at the Amish market to becoming a stripper to clinching the throne as the Billboard Hot 100 Queen. The rapper has amassed a $40 million net worth through her music and social media presence.</p><p>Her successful career began in the South Bronx, where she grew up in a poor part of town. As one of the biggest female rappers globally, her story is about perseverance and never giving up. Let’s take a look at how Cardi B struggled her way to the top.</p><h2 id=the-manhattan-hustle>The Manhattan Hustle</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Known for her distinctive New York street slang and Spanish accent, Cardi B grew up surrounded by multicultural influences. Her mother is from Trinidad, while her father is from the Dominican Republic. Living in a Latino neighborhood allowed her to be around various ethnicities, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harper’s Bazar</a>. She is proud of her roots and acknowledges the South Bronx to be an essential part of her success.</p><p>As a teenager, Cardi B worked as a cashier at the Amish Market in TriBeCa, earning $250/week until she was fired from her job when the market manager suggested that she should try her hand at stripping. At the age of 19, fired from her job, she started working at New York Dolls strip club, where she earned $100 a day. The rapper lied to her mother that she was babysitting children to earn her cash while working the job.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cardi B is grateful for her career as a stripper that she credits to saving her life. After working at lucrative spots in Manhattan, the rapper became financially stable with her job. She was in an abusive relationship with an ex-boyfriend who she left after earning enough money to survive by herself. While working as a stripper, Cardi B slowly gained Internet fame on Vine, Instagram, and Twitter.
