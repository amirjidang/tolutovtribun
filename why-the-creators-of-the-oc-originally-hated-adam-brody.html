Fans of the show often cite Seth Cohen as their favorite character, and he definitely had a major impact on pop culture at the time. Seth encouraged teenagers to embrace their weirdness and gave them someone to look up to when they felt like they didn’t fit in. And arguably, there’s no one else that could’ve pulled off Seth Cohen as perfectly as Adam Brody.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adam Brody first knew <a href=#>he wanted to be an actor after working as a clerk at Blockbuster</a>. Since then, he’s put a lot of work into honing his craft and doing his roles justice. But when he went in to audition for The O.C.’s creators for the first time, they were less than impressed. Read on to find out why!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Adam Brody And Meghan Fox's Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=adam-brody-as-seth-cohen>Adam Brody As Seth Cohen</h2><p>The O.C. debuted on the Fox network in 2003 and instantly won over millions of loyal fans. The show follows the lives of a group of wealthy teenagers living in California’s Newport Beach. One of the show’s most popular characters, still to this day, is Seth Cohen, who was played by Adam Brody.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seth won over the hearts of fans all over the world, but he’s not your average heartthrob. This geeky character was written to represent those who felt like they didn’t fit into high school. Before the show starts, Seth is an outcast who’s shunned by the rest of his classmates.</p><p>It takes a special kind of actor to bring a character as lovable as Seth to life. The show’s creators eventually settled on Adam Brody, <a href=#>who understandably doesn’t want to talk about </a><a href=#>The O.C.</a> much these days, for the role of Seth, but they weren’t so convinced at first.</p><h2 id=josh-schwartz-rsquo-s-first-impression>Josh Schwartz’s First Impression</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Josh Schwartz created The O.C. and served as a producer on the show, so his opinion counts for a lot. When Adam Brody came in for his first audition, he didn’t wow Schwartz. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he didn’t even impress him</a>. But his issues with Brody weren’t regarding his talent or suitability for the role. His bone to pick was more with Brody’s work ethic and attitude.</p><p>“It was pilot season and he [Brody] was going on dozens of auditions,” Schwartz said in an interview with The Daily Beast (via Cheat Sheet), “and he didn’t really bother to learn the lines, so he just came in and I was like, ‘What scene is he doing? Is this even from our show?'”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are 'The O.C.'

It came to a point where they were struggling to find someone who could play Seth. That’s when Rush suggested to Schwartz that they call Brody back and give him another shot.</p><p>“And I thought, ‘That guy?’” Schwartz recalled. “I kind of hated that guy. He didn’t even learn any of the words!”</p><h2 id=a-second-chance>A Second Chance</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, Schwartz went against his gut feeling and called Brody back for a second chance. This time, the young actor was much more prepared. He rehearsed properly for the audition and was able to show them his true potential.</p><p>“But he came back, learned the words, and he was great,” Schwartz said.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Leighton Meester And Adam Brody Really Met</a></span></p><h2 id=brody-rsquo-s-criticisms-of-the-show>Brody’s Criticisms Of The Show</h2><p>Criticism goes both ways. While Josh Schwartz originally had an issue with Adam Brody’s lack of preparation for his first audition, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brody has since spoken out about elements of the show that he wasn’t a fan of</a>, even though he loved being on the show overall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In particular, he didn’t enjoy the Season Two episode ‘The Mallpisode’: “I just remember thinking, 'Oh no, this is feeling so untethered from what it was,’” he revealed (via Digital Spy). He also wasn’t a fan of the way his character’s on-screen relationship with Summer Roberts played out, with the two breaking up and getting back together so many times: “And I felt like, still feel like, if we would've stayed apart for a year and the audience [was] dying to have them back together but they just can't make it, I think [we] could've wrung some more out of that."</p><h2 id=the-cultural-impact-of-seth-cohen>The Cultural Impact Of Seth Cohen</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the end, Adam Brody was born to play Seth Cohen. The show arguably wouldn’t have been such a success without Brody’s take on Seth, since that’s one of the most endearing elements that won over so many die-hard fans.</p><p>Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brody has now moved on from Seth Cohen</a>, he understands why Seth was such a hit with fans. Josh Schwartz summed it up nicely at the ATX TV Festival in 2016: "I think [he] gave voice to a kind of kid who once they got to college was going to be fine, was going to do great, but in high school, where conformity is key, those kind of kids who can't quite conform and want to live outside of that a little bit, hadn't really had somebody to really look to onscreen who had all those qualities and got to get the girl, as well."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Are Rachel Bilson And Mischa Barton Still Friends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqbWmecKrnJqsn6fAbrvFZquhnV2ksG670aKeoqaRobm6eceaq56cXZaxormMm6monKlk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-the-creators-of-the-oc-originally-hated-adam-brody.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-the-creators-of-the-oc-originally-hated-adam-brody.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-the-creators-of-the-oc-originally-hated-adam-brody.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-the-creators-of-the-oc-originally-hated-adam-brody.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-the-creators-of-the-oc-originally-hated-adam-brody.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-the-creators-of-the-oc-originally-hated-adam-brody.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./zac-effron-character-ted-bundy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./zac-effron-character-ted-bundy.html>Zac Efron Details How He Got In Character To Play Ted Bundy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-natalie-portman-husband-benjamin-millepied-affair-details.html>Why Everyone Is Talking About Natalie Portman's Husband And His 'Enormous Mistake'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-natalie-portman-husband-benjamin-millepied-affair-details.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
