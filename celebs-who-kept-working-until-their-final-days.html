Going from playing a cheeky brother to a leading man, Rooney spent decades in the business, bringing his name to hundreds of films, both in background and taking the lead. Rooney’s death in 2014 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">at the age of 93</a> came as a shock to some, however, his work was far from done. At the time of his death, Rooney was involved in two films: Night at the Museum, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. While Night at the Museum released in 2014, his work as Mr. Louis in Jekyll and Hyde aired in 2017, three years after his passing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=freddie-mercury-kept-love-alive><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Freddie Mercury Kept Love Alive</span></h2><p>The frontman of Queen underwent a painful and lengthy sickness prior to his final days. While the singer battled AIDS, he kept his work going, staying in the recording booth for as long as he was able to. His final time in the studio was assisted by a cane as Mercury was no longer able to stand for lengthy periods of time. His last recorded track, “Mother Love” was done in studio in May 1991 with bandmate and songwriter Brian May filling in on the last verse as Mercury was unable to do so. The singer passed only <a href=#>months later on November 24, 1991</a>.</p><h2 id=christopher-plummer-kept-up-with-his-passion><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Christopher Plummer Kept Up With His Passion</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Few actors maintain their health and passions long enough to keep going in their older age. Christopher Plummer worked through to age 91 and was mid-project with Canadian drama Departure when he passed away. The actor saw an astonishing three film releases in the year leading up to his death and, when asked why he continued working, was always quick to say <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“No, never retire.

The comedian, born in 1896, worked steadily with his partner in stage and life, Gracie Allen, working from stand-up to television and film. The actor’s final film, Radioland Murders, aired in 1994, but Burns kept up his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appearances in TV commercials and clubs</a> right up until the end in 1996.</p><h2 id=michael-jackson-was-working-on-a-release><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Michael Jackson Was Working On A Release</span></h2><p>The death of Michael Jackson in 2009 seemed to shock the nation as the then-50-year-old seemingly went overnight. The public outcry at the sudden loss hit hard as, while the singer <a href=#>hadn’t been as prevalent in the press prior to his death</a>, he was working on two albums at the time of his passing. Working on both a pop and an instrumental classical album, his estate <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">went on to release his documentary</a>This Is It as well as additional new tracks the artist had been working on at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> Michael Jackson's Nephew Has Some Opinions About Harry Styles Being Called The "King Of Pop"</a></span></p><h2 id=elvis-presley-left-the-building-mid-tour><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Elvis Presley Left The Building Mid-Tour</span></h2><p>Since the<a href=#> release of Elvis</a>, Presley’s name has seen the spotlight more as his life story became public knowledge. While his struggles during life were his own to deal with, his death came during a time of sporadic performances. The singer rested in his home at Graceland the night of August 15th, meant to fly out to Portland, Maine the following day for a show. Instead, Presley was found to have passed away due to a heart attack, leaving his fans around the world in shock at the sudden passing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=burt-reynolds-never-rested><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Burt Reynolds Never Rested</span></h2><p>Icon Burt Reynolds <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">passed away at age 82</a> without having taken a pause in his acting career.
