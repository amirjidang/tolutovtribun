With <a href=#>the feud between Messing and her co-star, Mullally</a>, fans may be wondering if Hayes and Messing are close in real life.

The two have great love and respect for one another and have quite a bit in common, from various health issues to love for Broadway. Let's take a look at Hayes and Messing's wonderful friendship.</p><h2 id=debra-messing-appeared-on-sean-hayes-39-podcast><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Debra Messing Appeared On Sean Hayes' Podcast</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Messing appeared on Hayes' podcast, Hypochondriactor</a>, where the two chatted about Messing's various ailments (both real and fake) over the years. It was on this podcast that fans may have realized just how close these two former co-stars are. They apparently text each other all the time and have commiserated over each other's health struggles over the years.</p><h2 id=debra-messing-and-sean-hayes-took-buzzfeed-39-s-bff-test><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Debra Messing And Sean Hayes Took Buzzfeed's BFF Test</span></h2><p>Hayes and Messing did the Buzzfeed BFF test on YouTube. One of the questions on the test was "what is one thing Sean can't live without?" Hayes answered with "Scotty", who is his husband, and Messing answered with "me" and faked crying when she discovered Hayes didn't put her as his answer. Hayes laughed and said "that was a good answer, which is true. Both people," he said. Besides that, their answers were pretty much the same for all of the questions, proving the two know each other very well after working together for so many years. At the end of the test, Messing very sweetly said, "I knew that Sean was my brother, but through this game, I learned that he really is my best friend." Hayes then responded and said, "I learned that because she just said that, I would probably sleep with her. I also learned that that's probably not true. But I also wanna say I learned nothing because I already know everything about her." So sweet!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Cast Member From 'Will & Grace' Has Landed The Most Roles Since The Show Ended In 2020?</a></span></p><h2 id=debra-messing-supported-sean-hayes-on-broadway><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Debra Messing Supported Sean Hayes On Broadway</span></h2><p>On the opening night red carpet for Hayes' run on Broadway in An Act of God, Messing told Theater Mania that Hayes was like "her brother" and that he made her laugh "more than anyone in the world." She went on to say that "he really is touched with comic genius." The two friends posed for photos together at the after-party, as well. Messing has always loved Broadway and the theater and studied theater in college.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sean-hayes-noticed-when-debra-messing-stopped-smoking><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Sean Hayes Noticed When Debra Messing Stopped Smoking</span></h2><p>On the Hypochondriactor podcast, Messing spoke about what finally made her quit smoking. It was when she got pregnant with her son, Roman. Hayes recalls weirdly catching Messing on the set of Will & Grace no longer smoking, and he asked her what was going on. She tried to play it off like it was nothing out of the ordinary but then revealed to him that she was pregnant. Before her pregnancy, she relied on smoking to help with her anxiety.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Much The 'Will & Grace' Cast Was Paid Per Episode</a></span></p><h2 id=sean-hayes-was-sick-during-debra-messing-39-s-star-on-the-walk-of-fame-ceremony><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sean Hayes Was Sick During Debra Messing's Star On The Walk Of Fame Ceremony</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Messing received her star on the walk of fame in October 2017. Messing mentioned at the ceremony that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her Will & Grace co-star Hayes was "under the weather"</a>, and that was the reason why he couldn't be there, but that she missed him very much, according to Today. She went on to say that Mullally and McCormack were here "brother and sister, my husband and wife -- my family. They are everything to me." For those who are familiar with Hayes' Hypochondriactor podcast, they are aware of how often the actor gets sick.</p><h2 id=sean-hayes-guest-starred-on-debra-messing-39-s-show-39-smash-39><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sean Hayes Guest Starred On Debra Messing's Show 'Smash'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the two former co-stars didn't have any scenes together on the NBC series, Smash, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hayes did a multiple-episode arc on Messing's series</a>. Hayes played the character of Terrence Falls, who, according to TVLine, was a "comedic television and film star who is making his Broadway debut in the musical Liaisons, based on the novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses. Due to a series of comic circumstances, he becomes a major thorn in the side for Ivy Lynn and other characters." It's a bummer the two friends didn't have any scenes together, though.</p><h2 id=sean-hayes-pinched-debra-messing-39-s-butt-at-every-will-amp-grace-curtain-call><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sean Hayes Pinched Debra Messing's Butt At Every Will & Grace Curtain Call</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For those who have been to a live taping of Will & Grace or have seen clips from tapings, they will know that Hayes always pinched Messing's butt when she and Eric McCormack took their bows during the curtain calls. Mullally simultaneously would pinch McCormack's butt during each curtain call. The two would have to be pretty close in order for Hayes to do that, right? The tradition ran through the first run of the series and continued on through the reboot.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'Will & Grace': Who Has The Highest Net Worth In 2021?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dqLKiuoyhmLKdo2Kxpq7RmmSmnaOotq%2BzjJ%2Bpop2emcBuvsSao2akmZuycA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-sean-hayes-debra-messing-friends-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fare-sean-hayes-debra-messing-friends-real-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fare-sean-hayes-debra-messing-friends-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fare-sean-hayes-debra-messing-friends-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-sean-hayes-debra-messing-friends-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-sean-hayes-debra-messing-friends-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-forgotten-americans-on-the-virgin-islands-543835.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-forgotten-americans-on-the-virgin-islands-543835.html>U.S. Virgin Islands Are Still Suffering Post-Hurricane Maria</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./taylor-swifts-lover-went-from-wedding-song-to-red-flag-warning.html>Taylor Swift's Lover Went From Wedding Song to 'Red Flag' Warning</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./taylor-swifts-lover-went-from-wedding-song-to-red-flag-warning.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
