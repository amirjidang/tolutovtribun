Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is a very well-known American actor, having starred in many popular movies such as Baywatch, Jungle Cruise, Red Notice, Jumanji, San Andreas, and Fast and Furious. He has also performed in the WWE over the span of his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Logan Paul, however, had a different rise to fame. The young socialite first became popular with his brother on the popular video-sharing platform Vine. After finding large swathes of success with his brother, they then moved on to producing outlandish, jam-packed VLOG-style videos for their YouTube channels.</p><p>They were a roaring success, and despite having gone through many controversies, the two Paul brothers have certainly made a name for themselves within the entertainment industry. <a href=#>Logan has even dabbled in the boxing world</a>, however, <a href=#>he, unfortunately, shattered his hand</a> on one occasion.</p><p>At first, though, Logan had a friend in Dwayne Johson. That has, apparently, changed.</p><h2 id=how-did-logan-paul-meet-dwayne-johnson>How Did Logan Paul Meet Dwayne Johnson?</h2><p>As Logan flung himself headfirst into the spotlight, he found himself forming many new ties within the Hollywood sphere, including Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. So, how exactly did the pair meet each other?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The pair reportedly met in 2016</a>, shortly before the peak of Logan's career. During this time, both Logan and Dwayne recorded several videos together in collaboration, first filming together in 2016.</p><p>Their first video together was posted in December, where he mentions his admiration for the American actor and wrestler, saying he has the 'utmost respect' for him.</p><p>After their first collaboration, they then went on to film two more videos together, where they seemed to portray their clear admiration for one another. They began to film together more in 2017, often referring to each other as 'bro' and 'brother', an indicator that the pair had since formed a solid friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="This Is What It’s Like To Date Logan Paul, According To His Ex-Girlfriends">This Is What It’s Like To Date Logan Paul, According To His Ex-Girlfriends</a></span></p><p>Logan even recalled on his podcast how he was 'shaking like a little girl' the first time he met Dwayne, a clear sign to show how much he admired the star. However, it would appear that their friendship would soon come crashing down.</p><h2 id=dwayne-lsquo-the-rock-rsquo-johnson-ended-his-friendship-with-logan-paul>Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson Ended His Friendship With Logan Paul</h2><p>Despite forming a seemingly solid friendship with Dwayne Johnson, their friendship eventually came to an abrupt end. So, what is the real reason for Dwayne cutting off the 27-year-old YouTuber?</p><p>In an episode of the True Geordie podcast, Logan revealed the real reason why their friendship came to a grinding halt. During the episode, Logan revealed how he got a call from Dwayne's publicist following his famous 'suicide forest video', a move that led to serious backlash for the star, causing him to lose sponsorship deals, friends, money, and subscribers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was one of the biggest hits of his career.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="What's Going On With Liam Payne After That Awkward Logan Paul Interview?">What's Going On With Liam Payne After That Awkward Logan Paul Interview?</a></span></p><p>While Logan was on the call with Dwayne's publicist, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they reportedly told him</a> that Dwayne wanted him to 'remove every picture and video that you've done with him. Maybe in the future the relationship can be reconciled but for now he basically wants nothing to do with you.'</p><p>Despite making such a public mistake and losing a good friend, it seemed that Logan found the motivation to make a true change to his character.</p><p>“I was so disappointed in myself, and so I vowed to get better. I vowed to change, time passed, I start doing well… I just wanted to be able to build a relationship with Dwayne that didn’t end up happening.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="How Much Did Dwayne Johnson Pay For His Self-Proclaimed 'Fastest Private Jet In The World'?">How Much Did Dwayne Johnson Pay For His Self-Proclaimed 'Fastest Private Jet In The World'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite hopes that the pair would one day reconcile, it would appear that the two are no longer as close as they formerly were. However, how does Logan really feel towards Dwayne now that their friendship has come to an end?</p><h2 id=how-does-logan-feel-about-dwayne-johnson-today>How Does Logan Feel About Dwayne Johnson Today?</h2><p>Despite abruptly ending his friendship with Logan Paul, it seems that <a href=#>Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson still has other people he avoids</a>, and is taking the end of his friendship with Logan perhaps slightly better.</p><p>However, it appears that Logan took it a little harder than Dwayne. In response to the publicists' news, Logan revealed that he was 'heartbroken' during an episode of The True Geordie podcast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He went on to reveal that during that period of his life, he was feeling 'extremely low mentally' and that he 'found himself in a hole that he had never been in before'. This news likely opened that wound even more, after a frenzy of public backlash raining down on the YouTube socialite.</p><p>He also went onto reveal during the same episode that the news made him really sad:</p><p>"And I was so sad that my hero wanted nothing to do with me. And I was sad because I understood it, I really f***ed up.”</p><p>Although he has since rebuilt his career, it is likely that this period is a moment that Paul does not like to reflect upon. Since launching his own podcast, he has now managed to rebuild his online reputation, seeing it go from strength to strength.</p><p>He has even now launched his own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">energy drink brand Prime</a> with British Youtuber KSI.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dmcSixc2eZK2glWK%2FsK%2FKZqGooJ6ovK95wKebZqSfnK6vec%2BarKVlo6m2rbiMn6minZ6ZwHA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-and-logan-paul-still-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fare-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-and-logan-paul-still-friends.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fare-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-and-logan-paul-still-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fare-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-and-logan-paul-still-friends.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-and-logan-paul-still-friends.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-and-logan-paul-still-friends.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./evagloss-dark-spot-corrector-serum-amazon-beauty.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./evagloss-dark-spot-corrector-serum-amazon-beauty.html>Evagloss $18 Dark Spot Corrector Is The Best for Discoloration</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kim-basinger-higher-net-worth-ex-husband-alec-baldwin.html>Does Kim Basinger Have A Higher Net Worth Than Her Ex-Husband Alec Baldwin?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kim-basinger-higher-net-worth-ex-husband-alec-baldwin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
