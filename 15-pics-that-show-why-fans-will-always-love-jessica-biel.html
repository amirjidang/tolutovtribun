She has a killer body that comprises perfectly toned legs that seem to go on for miles and a booty even Beyonce would be proud of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We fell in love with Jessica way back in 1996 when she was first cast as Mary Camden in the hit series 7th Heaven. While the producers of the show weren't too pleased when she hit a rebellious streak, the world eagerly watched on as young virginal Mary Camden blossomed into a gorgeous vixen. Over the years we bore witness to Jess flaunting her bootylicious good looks in everything from beautiful Couture gowns to bikinis so skimpy they should come with an age restriction. Fashion is not always an easy thing to get right, especially if you are constantly hounded by the paparazzi who are eagerly waiting for you to mismatch your colors or wear sandals with your jeans.</p><p>Jess has been extremely lucky on the fashion front and only made a few blunders in the 20-odd years that she has been in the public eye. She also looks so incredibly good when she does get it right that we can forgive her for the occasional error in judgment that does creep in. That said, let's take a closer look at some of the times Jess&nbsp;stole the show with her fashion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=white-dress-wowzer>White Dress&nbsp;Wowzer</h2><p>In December 2011, just after rekindling her romance with now-hubby Justin Timberlake, <a href=#>Jessica Biel</a> arrived at the Ed Sullivan Theatre in New York City to promote her movie New Year’s Eve on The Late Show with David Letterman. Jess looked picture-perfect in a figure-hugging white Victoria Beckham dress that showed of her perfectly-toned legs and booty to salivating onlookers. Not one for extravagant hairdos, her long chocolate-brown tresses framed her flawless face beautifully, creating an impressive contrast against her snowy frock. She kept her accessories to the minimum, opting only for oversized hoop earrings and a pair of ultra-chic black and white booties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The evening could have turned into a highly-appreciated wet t-shirt (dress?) contest thanks to a mild downpour. Unfortunately, a pesky party pooper with an all-too-convenient umbrella ruined all the fun, making sure Ms. Biel was kept dry, and we deprived of some wet-material-clinging-to-hot-flesh shots. After flashing her million-dollar smile for the photographers, Jess zipped off to the Ziegfeld Theatre for an advance screening of her new film New Year’s Eve to benefit the Tribeca Film Institute. Judging by how hot Jessica was looking, it’s no wonder that JT proposed only a couple of months later, eager to make the stunning Jess his Mrs.</p><h2 id=stunning-in-berlin>Stunning in&nbsp;Berlin</h2><p>Only Jessica has the ability to go from looking like a pink deflated soufflé at the LA Premiere of Total Recall to looking like a million bucks at the Berlin Premiere a mere fortnight later. The actress looked radiant in a bejeweled, open-back halter-neck gown by Lebanese designer Elie Saab. Jess had her hair swept up in a tight bun but, sadly, the dreaded bangs were back – probably the only thing she can be faulted on. As far as accessories go, she decided to keep it a lot simpler than the kitsch granny-necklace and earring set she sported in LA. Her Ferragamo heels, Fendi clutch, and Lorraine Schwartz jewels were all perfect choices, and Jess even managed to outshine Colin Farrell in the hot-red-carpet look department.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for the movie that was being promoted, Total Recall ended up grossing an impressive $198,467,168 at the box office despite poor Jessica being nominated for a Razzie Award for her role as Melina. While she ultimately received mixed reviews for her performance, she undoubtedly brought a lot of sultry appeal to a character portrayed by Rachel Ticotin in the 1990 original. Poor Arnie would have had a hard time to concentrate on set with Jess’s long legs and shapely butt up in his face all the time!</p><h2 id=that-magazine-cover>THAT Magazine Cover</h2><p>Jessica was 24 years old when she made her final appearance on 7th Heaven during the shows' Season 10 finale in 2006. The following year, at age 25, she appeared on the cover of GQ magazine in a bikini so small it left very little to the imagination. The July 2007 issue featured 8 photos of Jess in a range of teeny bikinis and suggestive poses that undoubtedly caused at least a couple of guys to seek absolution for their filthy thoughts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jessica has always been modest about her beauty and was even quoted as saying: “It's not my plan or whatever in my life to be a sex symbol. It never is. You are who you are, but you can't help what you look like. And when you do a film, like for me, it's just not about that. I would prefer to downplay it. I prefer to downplay the s*x appeal.” Judging by these photos though, it is hard to believe she doesn’t look in the mirror from time to time thinking: “Damn I have a really good butt”. Who can blame her for thinking that anyway? If I had a booty like that I would have mirrors fixed on every last wall in my house!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wedding-day-bliss>Wedding Day Bliss</h2><p>When Jessica became Mrs. Timberlake in October 2012, the entire world waited with bated breath to see what the wedding dress would look like. When photos of the ceremony that took place in Italy were finally released, they didn’t disappoint! Jess was clad in a breathtakingly beautiful, frothy pink Giambattista Valli gown that made her look like a princess straight out of a Disney movie. When asked about her somewhat unusual choice in a wedding dress, Jessica stated that she wanted something romantic and feminine but added that she has never been a fan of a traditional all-white wedding dress. When the designer suggested a pink dress the daredevil in her obliged, without any hesitation the strapless dress was accessorized with simple, elegant earrings and a striking bouquet of chamomile, ranunculus, and ruscus.</p><p>While Jessica obviously stole the show, hubby JT didn’t look too shabby either. Donning a suave Tom Ford tux, Justin looked like a modern-day Prince Charming – one who couldn’t stop smiling next to his beautiful, blushing bride. No one can blame the&nbsp;guy though. Marrying one of the most desirable women in the world would leave any warm-blooded man (and more than likely some women) grinning from ear to ear too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-the-oscar-goes-to>And the Oscar Goes To......</h2><p>The day before her 32nd birthday, Jessica stunned at the 2014 Oscars where she presented the awards for Best Original Score and Best Original Song with Jamie Foxx. While some naysayers had the audacity to call her look boring, Jess looked positively radiant in a gorgeous nude Chanel Couture that was adorned with silver sequins. Although it was rather unfortunate that she had to walk the red carpet solo (it was later revealed that JT was away on tour), she strutted her stuff like the fiercely independent woman she is, smiling for the cameras and making everyone around her look like frumpy housewives. With a body and face like Jess, it’s hardly any effort to look good. While the rest of us mere mortals have to spend hours in front of the mirror plastering our faces with makeup, Jess once again looked fresh-faced and glowing – opting for a minimalistic, natural look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even in a floor-length dress, it was clear that Jessica has a killer physique, and the cameras noticed too. It is no wonder poor Jamie had to resort to some on-stage shenanigans while presenting in order to steal some of the attention away from her. It will be interesting to see whether Jessica will ever be on the other side of the podium, receiving the coveted little gold statue for her own acting efforts.</p><h2 id=glowing-mom-to-be>Glowing Mom-to-Be</h2><p>Pregnant women are generally said to have a certain glow about them. When Jessica was pregnant with son Silas, she took glowing to a whole new level, looking absolutely radiant, despite sticking to a rather hectic work schedule. Jess, who was 32-years-old at the time, didn’t allow her pregnancy to slow her down while working on The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea, a movie she both produced and starred in. Although she was frequently spotted in baggy pants and t-shirts, Jess didn’t let herself go during her pregnancy and continued to stay active and eat healthy, engaging in yoga, gentle hikes and eating delish farm-to-table food.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We have seen a lot of celeb moms-to-be trying their damndest to maintain their high-maintenance, pre-pregnancy glamorous looks (remember Kim K's leather and lace disgrace?), but not our Jess. She was quite happy to just wear whatever was most comfortable on the day and didn't even bother with makeup most of the time reiterating why she is known as a true natural beauty. Even while doing shopping with a ballooning stomach she managed to turn heads, something which many of us fail to do even after spending an entire day in a beauty salon!</p><h2 id=beautiful-baby-mama>Beautiful Baby Mama</h2><p>Just when we thought Jessica could not possibly look any more beautiful than she did during her pregnancy, she gave birth to little Silas Randall on 8 April 2015. During an interview earlier this year, Jess admitted to the immense pressure she felt to lose weight after giving birth. The pressure and regular workout sessions with personal trainer Jason Walsh clearly paid off as Jess was sporting a gorgeous post-baby body a mere month after Silas made his appearance. &nbsp;Although we were all rather impressed by the sheer speed at which she got her hot bod back, it was the way new motherhood looked on her that was most captivating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>New moms often look worse for wear sporting mom hair, baby-vomit shirts, and the tell-tale dark rings from sleepless nights under their eyes. Jess, on the other hand, looked like she just stepped out of a Living & Loving magazine. She was all bright eyed and bushy tailed whenever photos of her and her newborn surfaced. Not even Prince William's Kate managed to look this good after having babies 1, 2 and 3 and she has an entire castle at her beck and call! It would really be a pity if Jess and JT didn't have a whole football team of kids. Not only do they make gorgeous babies but parenthood really does suit the Timberlake's rather well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=black-out-beautiful>Black-Out Beautiful</h2><p>2018 has been a good year so far for Jess with regards to the fashion choices she has made. She arrived at this year’s Golden Globes Award Ceremony wearing a magnificent black princess gown with a gorgeous velvet and tulle finish from Dior Haute Couture. Jess didn’t randomly pick a black dress. She joined America Ferrera, Eva Longoria and Reese Witherspoon (the amazing women behind Hollywood’s anti-harassment movement known as Time’s Up) in wearing black to the ceremony in a demonstration of their solidarity with women affected by various forms of sexual harassment. Even hubby JT joined in the black-out looking ultra-hot in an all-black Dior suit, grinning widely next to his gorgeous wife.</p><p>Apart from dressing (rather spectacularly) for a good cause, Jess also more than looked the part of the award nominee she was. Her extraordinary work in The Sinner earned her a lot of praise and has seemed to have finally established her as a serious actress. Sadly our Jess didn’t take home the award (Nicole Kidman did) but we are super proud of her anyway. Could this nomination be the start of great things to come? If it means seeing more of Jess dressed like this, we sure hope so!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-booty-was-made-for-the-beach>This Booty was Made for the Beach!</h2><p>There are two types of people in the world: those who can proudly wear skimpy bikinis and those who can't. Unfortunately, most of the female population qualifies as the latter but Jessica definitely falls into the former category if the photos of her 2012 Puerto Rican holiday with JT are anything to go by. The couple, who were engaged at the time, was in the Caribbean country where Justin was filming Runner, Runner. Justin might be an award-winning superstar but all eyes were definitely on his gorgeous fiance as they were playing paddle board on the beach. Dressed in skimpy bikinis and wetsuits, Jessica didn't seem too fazed by the paparazzi taking photos and ogling her toned legs and sexy butt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beautiful women are not a rare find in Puerto Rico (Stephanie Del Valle took the Miss World title in 2016). Jessica's beauty is a whole different ballgame though. Apart from being striking lovely, she also oozes appeal to the extent where elderly men might have to reach for their heart medication when she is in the vicinity. As long as Jess prances around in her beachwear there are bound to be a few disgruntled women dragging their drooling men away from the ocean.</p><h2 id=those-legs>Those Legs!!!</h2><p>Put Jessica Biel in a Ralph & Russo gown with a plunging neckline and a slit up to her hip and you can expect the nation to have collective heart palpitations. The shimmering nude dress made Jess look ethereal and catapulted her to the top of the 'best-dressed' list for the evening. What was the striking dress in aid of? The 2017 Emmys of course! Jess wasn’t just at the ceremony as an attendee either, she presented the award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or a Movie (which was won by the hunky Riz Ahmed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Judging by her perfectly-styled bouffant and flawless makeup it is hard to believe poor Jess had to face a fashion nightmare en-route to the prestigious event when the AC in her car malfunctioned and she was virtually stuck to the seat with sweat for almost an hour. As with the 2014 Oscars, Jess once again walked the red carpet solo. It might have been a blessing in disguise that JT wasn’t present the way onlookers were gawking at his wife’s long legs. When asked about her hubby’s absence, Jess nonchalantly pointed out that he was out of town headlining ‘Rock in Rio’ in Brazil.</p><h2 id=pretty-in-purple>Pretty in Purple</h2><p>Very few people (except maybe the Queen of England) can pull off a lavender ensemble without looking like Barney the Dinosaur. Jessica is one of the lucky few with a complexion so perfect she could possibly wear a hangover-vomit yellow dress and still look good. When she attended the NBC Universal Press Junket at Beauty and Essex in LA, California during November 2017, she looked positively edible in a purple jumpsuit from Zuhair Murad's Spring 2017 Collection. Although Jess looks gorgeous, as usual, this was a rather demure creation from Zuhair as he is known for his super-gorgeous, bedazzled pieces.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jess accessorized the somewhat unusual outfit perfectly with a pair of nude heels, classic jewelry, and a very feminine lace band that matched her outfit perfectly. Her makeup was flawless as usual but the crows feet at the corners of her eyes indicate that even the most beautiful amongst us aren't immune to the aging process. With all the money in the world at her disposal and obviously good genes, Jess probably doesn’t have to worry too much about turning into Nanny McPhee anytime soon. She will probably be the hottest 80-year-old the world has ever seen one day as well!</p><h2 id=all-suited-up>All Suited Up</h2><p>Is there any outfit on earth that Jessica doesn't look gorgeous in? Judging by these photos, apparently not! Couples are often believed to mutate into each other and that is exactly what Jessica and Justin seemingly did not even a year into their marriage. When the loving couple attended the Las Vegas premiere of JT's movie Runner Runner in September 2013, they decided to wear similar tuxedos! Jessica's look, a Dolce & Gabanna ensemble consisting of fitted pants, a white shirt, and the styled jacket was basically just a feminine version of what Justin was sporting. To complement the sleek line of the tux, Jess kept her accessories to a minimum, opting only for a few elegant pieces of Martin Katz jewelry and a Mark Cross bag.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It definitely takes a brave, and exquisite women to pull off a look so many others have failed at dismally (remember Diane Keaton’s Willy Wonka disaster at the 2004 Oscars?) Both Mr & Mrs Timberlake looked picture-perfect but, if we had to pick who wore it better, we'd have to go with Jess as her sculpted body and dazzling smile will put her husband to shame each and every time. Good on you Jess, you wear man pants better than any man can!</p><h2 id=platinum-princess>Platinum Princess</h2><p>When Jess arrived at the 2008 BAFTA's donning a black strapless Alexander McQueen gown and platinum blonde hair, I for one feared she had another rebellious episode, similar to the one she had while starring in 7th Heaven. Back then Jess cut her long golden-brown hair, and bleached it, much to the dismay of the producers and head-honcho Aaron Spelling. She got into even bigger trouble when her friends thought it was a good idea to send a&nbsp;dancer to the set in celebration of her 18th birthday - clearly, the idea wasn't so good after all as it seriously infringed on the wholesome image the show was trying to portray.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back to the BAFTAs! Jess looked super hot with that blonde hairdo she acquired for her role as Larita Whittaker in British film Easy Virtue! At first glance, she actually looks a lot like a Homeland-era Claire Danes, although Claire could only dream of having a&nbsp;body like Jess. Of course, there was your token handful of moaning molly's who complained that the blonde hair made her look old and even washed out but chances are Jess didn't give a hoot what the critics said as she received a rather nice paycheck for her role in the movie.</p><h2 id=what-a-beautiful-bird-she-is>What a Beautiful Bird She Is</h2><p>In 2001 Bjork walked the red carpet at the Oscars wearing a dress resembling a swan. The poor songbird (no pun intended) still hasn't lived that fashion disaster down! 12 years later Jessica Biel managed to show the world what a true swan princess looks like. After a super-fast trip to Monaco for the 2014 Dior Cruise presentation, she sailed down the red carpet at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival for the premiere of JT's Inside Llewyn Davis in which he stars alongside Carey Mulligan and Garrett Hedlund.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jess's otherworldly pale dove-grey embroidered gown with the feathery finish came from Marchesa's 2012 Fall collection and was paired with a heavily embellished Marchesa clutch and an interesting serpent necklace. While her look triggered mixed reactions from fashion critics, not even a blind man will be able to dispute the fact that Jess once again looked like a fairy-tale princess. It is no wonder JT always looks so perpetually happy. Not only does he get to see his gorgeous wife almost daily, but he also gets to see her take those adorable gowns off when they get home after a long night of walking red carpets and smiling at countless cameras.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=black-leather-hotness>Black Leather Hotness</h2><p>When the average mortal woman wears a black leather,&nbsp;the chances are good that she will put Fat Amy from the Pitch Perfect franchise to shame with all the blubbery bulges that choose to present themselves at the most inopportune of times. Then there is, of course, Jessica Biel who, at 31-years of age, made every living, breathing man in New York hot under the collar when she arrived at the annual Daily Front Row Fashion Media Awards in a skin-tight leather dress. The knee-length creation clung to Jess's curves in all the right places and was perfectly offset by a pair of multi-colored kitten heels and a trendy clutch.</p><p>The world has become so accustomed to Jess wearing elegant, shiny gowns that this super-sultry dress is actually quite refreshing. Jess looked positively beaming in all the photos that surfaced from the event, flashing her pearly whites at the cameras. JT is one lucky man to call this lovely lass his wife and baby-mama. To be able to come home to that body and face must be one of the greatest pleasures ever bestowed upon the former boy-bander.
