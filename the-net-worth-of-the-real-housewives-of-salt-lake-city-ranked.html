It is digestible, fun, and the unnecessary drama that is always unfolding is somehow very addicting to watch. One of the most popular reality shows on tv right now is <a href=#>The Real Housewives franchise</a>. The show documents the professional and personal lives of a group of wealthy women, and their families and friends, residing in a specific city.</p><p>The US franchise is one of the more successful spin-offs, garnering hundreds of thousands of views, 14 seasons, and giving the women millions of dollars in return. With so many Real Housewives shows on TV right now, it’s difficult to keep track of anyone’s net worth. But one thing is for sure: The women on The Real Housewives franchise are some of the wealthiest women on the planet.</p><p>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City spin-off boasts some of the most popular cast members in the history of the show. That said, fans might be curious who among these affluent women is the richest of them all. Curious to find out?

Meredith was once a real estate agent, but now she is a celebrity jewelry designer, with clientele such as Rihanna, Charlize Theron, and Courteney Cox. Her designs are inspired by the ethos of livable luxury, making pieces that are reminiscent of one’s passions and purpose.</p><p>Her jewelry is versatile and multi-functional, such as earrings that could double as pendants. Meredith owns a jewelry store on Main Street in Park City. Currently, she has a net worth of $1 million.</p><h2 id=angie-harrington>Angie Harrington</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Angie has been with the show since the beginning, and she is one housewife worth mentioning despite not being in the main cast. She is Lisa’s close friend of over 20 years, though the pair had a fairly recent falling out. Angie is a fashion blogger and influencer and is currently married to Chris Harrington. Chris is the CRO for Entrata, a big software provider.</p><p>Angie and her husband have a transgender kid, and thus they do not practice Mormonism. Although the <a href=#>transgender community has mind-blowing facts</a>,&nbsp; they are widely accepted these days. They state that they decided to forgo it until the rules for everyone were equal. Her current net worth stands at $1.7 million.</p><h2 id=heather-gay>Heather Gay</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Outspoken, fun, and dances to the beat of her own drum, these are just some of Heather Gay’s best qualities. Despite being raised in a conservative, Mormon household, Heather doesn’t hold back on saying what she wants – both on and off-screen. That said, because of the nature of the show she’s in, it’s no surprise that Heather’s family doesn’t support her career decisions.</p><p>Specifically, Heather airing her dirty laundry on TV for the world to see. Heather married into Mormon royalty and also opened a med spa recently. Her current net worth is $1.7 million.</p><h2 id=whitney-rose>Whitney Rose</h2><p>Businesswoman and blonde bombshell, Whitney Rose, is the third person on our list. Whitney is also a descendant of Mormon Royalty, meaning her ancestors were part of the Mormon pioneers in US history. However, due to past childhood trauma, she has left the church and is now gearing up to live an independent life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She’s been married for 10 years now and has two kids, Bobbi and Brooks. Whitney owns a skincare and beauty brand called Wild Rose Beauty, which is also the main source of her income. In 2022, her net worth is $3 million.</p><h2 id=jen-shah>Jen Shah</h2><p>Jen Shah is one of the most controversial <a href=#>cast members of The Real Housewives</a> franchise, and for good reason. Jen has been portrayed as the icon of wealth and glamour, only to be arrested for fraud charges. She and her assistant, Stuart Smith, were arrested after authorities found out that the pair had been running a nationwide telemarketing scheme for over 10 years.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jen Shah </a>pleaded not guilty, but she’s facing a maximum of 50 years in prison. That said, Jen’s net worth still stands at $3 million – though that could change any time now.</p><h2 id=jennie-nguyen>Jennie Nguyen</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another controversial cast member is Jennie Nguyen, who was fired from The Real Housewives franchise in January of this year. Following the height of the Black Lives Matter movement, Jennie made some eyebrow-raising social media posts that sparked outrage and backlash. Some people called her out for being racist, too.</p><p>Jennie moved to the US from Vietnam to live out her dreams. Before joining the cast, she owned a medical spa which she recently sold. Currently, she also has a net worth of $3 million.</p><h2 id=lisa-barlow>Lisa Barlow</h2><p><a href=#>Self-made millionaire Lisa Barlow</a>&nbsp;is successful all on her own. The New York native moved to Salt Lake City after college, saying that she just fell in love with the city. Since then, she’s focused on making her dreams come true. She started a marketing company called Luxe. Despite the Mormon religion frowning upon alcohol consumption, Lisa founded a tequila brand called VIDA and profits off of it. Despite The Real Housewives franchise being her first TV show ever, Lisa already had an impressive social media following. Her current net worth stands at $5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mary-cosby>Mary Cosby</h2><p>Mary M. Cosby, the cast’s most polarizing star, has an estimated net worth of $5 million in both income and properties. She inherited her family’s empire of churches, restaurants, and then some more. The catch? She married her late grandmother’s second husband, Robert Cosby Sr. to gain access to all that wealth. Although her story seems like a plotline straight out of Game of Thrones, she and her husband have been married for over 20 years now, and they have a son together.</p><h2></h2><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="A Peek Inside The Luxurious Homes Of 'The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills'" href=#>A Peek Inside The Luxurious Homes Of 'The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills'</a></span></p><p>Sources:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Bravo TV</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Over Mind</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMp5ytZaekv7W0jKidZqyYmnqzscClZKGnpaiyuLXVnqpmp5ZiwKK402ajmqOVYrCqwNhmqZqmm5qxcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-net-worth-of-the-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-net-worth-of-the-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city-ranked.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-net-worth-of-the-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-net-worth-of-the-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-net-worth-of-the-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-net-worth-of-the-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-office-ellie-kemper-bio-husband-child-height-net-worth-bra-size-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-office-ellie-kemper-bio-husband-child-height-net-worth-bra-size-wiki.html>The Office Ellie Kemper: Bio, Husband, Child, Height, Net Worth, Bra Size, Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./meet-sheryl-sandberg-the-coo-of-meta-platforms-who-is-worth-1-5-billion.html>The COO Of Meta Platforms Who Is Worth $1.5 Billion</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./meet-sheryl-sandberg-the-coo-of-meta-platforms-who-is-worth-1-5-billion.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
